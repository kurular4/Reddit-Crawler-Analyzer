I usually visit Shimla and Manali on my trips, and they are both very beautiful. Since you are travelling during winter, Manali may prove to be a challenge as heavy snowfall can sometimes hinder road travel. Its worth the hassle however. Some of my relatives have gone further north to Ladakh and Kashmir, and they have said both are very nice place to visit. Kashmir can be a little troublesome due to its political climate. I cannot say if its worth the hassle like Manali is.",

I don't necessarily have any complains about them, but if I'm backpacking across India, I would go after the natural scenery in it than the cities. Having said that, I assume you might want to visit Agra and Jaipur to visit Taj Mahal and other Moghul landmarks, and they can be easily accessed from New Delhi. I have never been to Mumbai, or the more southern cities in India, so I can't comment on them.",

I have noticed a preference now for Filipino English support centres because they speak American English and their accent is a lot fainter than the Indian one. Low oil prices have really helped India's growth though, and we saw it suffer when those prices began to rise. Demonetisation also dealt a temporary blow to their growth but you'd still expect them to do better than Bangladesh in the long run. If Bangladesh can overtake India it will be a hell of a run, out of nowhere as well, it doesn't have anywhere near the economic recognition outside of textiles as India.",

Look at the CEOs of Microsoft and Google. It's unlikely that there's nothing like that domestically for India. I have noticed a preference now for Filipino English support centres because they speak American English and their accent is a lot fainter than the Indian one. Low oil prices have really helped India's growth though, and we saw it suffer when those prices began to rise. Demonetisation also dealt a temporary blow to their growth but you'd still expect them to do better than Bangladesh in the long run. If Bangladesh can overtake India it will be a hell of a run, out of nowhere as well, it doesn't have anywhere near the economic recognition outside of textiles as India.",

                    "Hi, I'm a stranger here but short story is that I'm the Art Director of a VR-game being released. I am born and raised in Sweden, but my parents are from Bangladesh; I've also visited Bangladesh on numerous occassions to visit my family there.",
                    "When developing this game, I explored a lot of options of where I wanted to go with the aesthetics.; a lot of games are based on either Western civilization, or East Asian civilization. In the end, I felt that I couldn't really channel any of these because they weren't really \"me\". And then I thought a lot about my parents talking about the war, the foundation of Bangladesh, and its rich history and decided that I wanted to make a game-world (it's still fake though, but based on) based on Bangladesh. I've always been a fan of very bright colors, and it's something that a lot of my artist peers have criticized me for, but I truly believe this is something that I pick up from heritage here; Bangladeshi aesthetics are also very vibrant and colorful.",
                    "I also wanted to use this platform to highlight that South Asian culture in games is always \"jungle in temples\", I wanted to show the more urban parts of it. And then I also decided to highlight the atrocities of 1971, so in this game, there are several references to this war.",
                    "It's a fun game, so please don't take this as any way of trying to minimize what has happened. I just wanted to use a fun platform, to be able to lift up a very grave and important issue. Not a lot of people know about this genocide, and my wish is that at least maybe one more person will.",
                    "If you're interested in this title, here's a link to our trailer:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_VRJqW01e4",
                    "I don't see how this is based on 1971 liberation war.  Anyway i would suggest you to promote on Facebook. You'd get proper desi attention there.",
                    "It’s sort of an interpretation of the aesthetics. In the full game there is a lot of things referring to it. One of the enemies is called razakars, referring to the Pakistani soldiers.. They have red eyes and spar an outfit that is based on the military outfits they used at the time, and their looks and animations are robotic, referring to how soldiers were able to kill innocent people with little to no regret.",
                    "There are some spirits in the game referring to “landscapes piled with bodies”, which is something my mother talked about when she was fleeing the war with her family. She talked about how everywhere she went, there were bodies piling on top of each other.",
                    "Throughout the game, there are spray paints of the symbol of Mukti Bahini, the rebel army that fought against the soldiers.",
                    "I’ve used the title “Bidrohi” in some cases, referring to when my father was jailed for political treason to the Pakistan Government, my grandfather tried every day to get him out, referring him to “Amar bidrohi chele”.",
                    "One of the models in the game is based on Madhur Canteen, the beginning of the grass rights movement of the rebellion.",
                    "There’s a reference to Archer Blood, the American diplomat who sent the telegram that have been said to start swaying the international opinion of the war, together with the Pakistani journalist.",
                    "There’s also a reference to Operation Searchlight, the operation that was intended to wipe out millions of innocent victims in favour of deterring any rebellion.",
                    "This is just from the top of my head, and we do have much more, but like I said, it’s maybe not so much that it’s reliving the atrocities, but More is about highlighting and giving credit to this.",
                    "Thank you for your advice! I will try spreading it there as well.",
                    "Ok. Now i see it. Kudos for effort.",
                    "Game looks pretty good. Didn't see any reference to the 71 war, but I saw your reply to another comment about the story and how the enemies are based on the razakars. I think that's really nice.",
                    "Only one thing, will this game be playable without a VR setup? Or is it VR compulsory? Since almost all gamers in Bangladesh don't have a VR setup, and most gamers in general.",
                    "Yes, it's a bit subtle in the game, but as I've mentioned there are some references here and there! I think also if people have it in mind, it'll become a lot more clear. I'm thinking of maybe one day making an explanation video of it.",
                    "Unfortunately, this is indeed a release that requires VR. It's a co-op game, so you're two players who help each other out in the game. I know that most people probably don't have VR... but, we're hoping that maybe one day in the future at least when VR is more accessible, more people might have it!",

                    "this article makes some good points, but overall misses the bigger picture. The indentured servitude and the inhuman treatment Bangladeshis and other South Asians face in the Gulf nations has more to do with class and race, and the failure of the BD govt (in the case of Bangladeshis) to provide their citizens with any form of rights or protection. Shahriar Kabir wrote extensively in the 90s about the abuse that domestic workers faced in Saudi Arabia, in both fictional and non-fictional accounts. However, at that time, the foreign remittance that the workers brought to the country were given more priority over their dignity and lives. And this is true for any construction workers (who are mostly male) that to UAE or other Gulf states. Over the last 20 years, reports of abuse and deaths at construction sites have been extensively published, but again, the BD govt has failed to provide any sort of protection.",
                    "As for the point of why foreign seems more lucrative, the writer fails to point out the effects of colonialism - 200 years of colonialism is hard to rub off in less than 50 years of independence. Additionally, the whole middle income country and graduating from LDC is a farce. GDP is an average and hides the increasing inequality in the country. Unless we actually address that, people will try to go abroad to make more money through indentured servitude for a better future and security for their families."

                    "Here on Reddit the general view is that gay rights are seen as progressive and liberal views are held as 'superior' and that conservative, religious views are seen as 'outdated' or 'backwards'. While the article states that Bangladesh has accepted 191 out of the 196 suggestions given, there's no mention of what the other 5 are, other than gay rights and the death penalty.",
                    "I may get downvoted for this but it doesn't matter as long as free speech still exists. The issue with gay rights here is that throughout human history it was always seen as an abomination, throughout most societies, cultures and religions. Only in the last 100 years, homosexuality has been declassified as a mental disorder and lgbt activism as well as tolerance for it has increased. In the case of Bangladesh, they still retain the conservative attitude, which I personally agree with. My take here is that I treat LGBT rights the same as human rights. At the end of the day we are all human and should all be treated fairly by all means. This doesn't mean that society's attitude will change in Bangladesh and that doesn't necessarily mean they are 'backwards'.",
                    "For the record, homosexuality is not publicly tolerated but people can still keep their shit private, a don't ask don't tell sort of thing. Bangladesh is also home to the 'Hijra', a minority group of transexuals who have been recognised as a third gender.",
                    "As for the death penalty, it's a controversial issue, especially in a corrupt as hell country like Bangladesh. Although the numbers do show that even after orders for the death penalty are given, there is a low percentage of people actually getting executed. IMO it should be for the highest of crimes such as terrorism and mass murder, otherwise, a life sentence should suffice. And for those caught in the death penalty, there must be concrete, indisputable proof.",
                    "If anything, after reading the article, we should be glad that there is constant development in that country, no matter how small it may seem. People here see the title and automatically associate Bangladesh as some backwards hellhole with no chance of improvement. Accepting 191 suggestions out of 196 is still very significant.",

                    "You're repeatedly saying contradictory statements. How can you agree with the conservative attitude towards LGBT while also saying that you agree that LGBT rights are human rights? That isn't a conservative attitude. You are saying that we are all human and should be treated fairly by all means while also saying that you don't agree with LGBT acceptance being an indictator (not the sole indicator) of progress and development.",
                    "This doesn't mean that society's attitude will change in Bangladesh and that doesn't necessarily mean they are 'backwards'.",
                    "I agree with the first part of your statement but not the second. Cultures can be progressive, neutral, and regressive in different aspects. There is no shame in admitting that Bangladeshi attitudes towards LGBT are backwards in comparison to Western cultures. You can say that Bangladeshi attitudes towards eating habits are progressive in comparison to Western habits of eating junk food. It's part of the definition. Things that are in direct opposition to progressive ideals are \"backwards\" or \"regressive\" by the definition.",
                    "For the record, homosexuality is not publicly tolerated but people can still keep their shit private, a don't ask don't tell sort of thing.",
                    "That doesn't mean anything at all. Literally any crime is not publicy tolerated as long as you keep it private. I can say murder, rape, selling drugs, piracy, theft, or any other crime is not publicly tolerated. No shit no one's gonna persecute you if no one knows you committed a crime. All your saying that if as long as no one knows your doing it, you're fine. But that doesn't change the fact that the action is still classified as a crime. If you don't consider this to be \"backwards\" I don't know what to tell you.",
                    "Although I agree with you that Bangladesh made the right move in not agreeing to the UN terms on these matters, I don't agree with your reasoning behind it.",

                    "Let me clarify what I meant. I mean that human rights are rights given for simply being human. Everyone is entitled to that regardless of religion or sexual orientation. I don't recognise lgbt rights as a specific separate thing which is necessary, just like how there's no need to have specific rights for being of a specific faith. Human rights cover all of that. If lgbt rights were the same as human rights in regards to the fair treatment of all people, then yes that's agreeable. However there is the civil issue of marriage which most people would associate with gay rights. That itself depends on one's definition of marriage, which Bangladesh sees as a union between man and woman. It is simply a difference in belief and by no means discrimination for lgbt people nor an indicator of being \"backwards\".",

                    "One can say that their country is superior because they treat gay people exactly the same as everyone else, including marriage, adoption etc. This does not mean that that country is objectively superior or progressive. This is completely subjective on what a culture might consider to be progressive or regressive. Conservative views see lgbt civil rights on marriage and adoption to be morally wrong, while the liberal view may not. Ultimately this stems down to what people see as right or wrong based on their fundamental principles and beliefs.",
                    "Although what we can both agree on is that fair treatment of all people, which is backed up by law and religion, regardless of what the common folk in society might think. And we shouldn't confuse between the fundamental human rights for all vs civil rights which vary by country and culture.",
                    "That doesn't mean anything at all. Literally any crime is not publicy tolerated as long as you keep it private.

                    "I agree with you on the most part. The main issue I see here is that homosexuality is criminalised in Bangladesh and you see that as backwards. It isn't easy to say if it's backwards or not, every law has reasoning behind it. It's a tough and sensitive issue to discuss obviously. My view is that as long as homosexuality is kept private and not publicly flaunted e.g. gay pride parades or trying to convince people it is normal and healthy then it is fine.",
                    "Admittedly, it stems from the view that homosexuality is wrong, hence why the law exists. I see it as too general and can be misused by corrupt people and for political purposes. I vehemently disagree with the view that seeing homosexuality as wrong is backwards. We can only agree to disagree here.",
                    "A more reasonable and progressive approach to the law on homosexuality should be that it should be decriminalised but should also come under public decency laws which can criminalise public parades of homosexuality or promotion of indecent behaviour. Gays can still be themselves in private without having to outrage the public.",
                    "upvoted for well written and thoughtful reply.  I do think there is a danger of LGBT rights becoming a tracker of progressiveness and development, and seen as a shortcut to a richer, more developed nation.",
                    "What is the current legal status in Bangladesh? You say people can keep their shit private. How many people are interested in other's shit?",
                    "The legal status is that homosexuality is still a criminal offence in Bangladesh. Meaning that if a gay couple were to publicly announce their activities, they would be imprisoned. If one were to browse gay content on their computer, they can since internet censorship is fairly low in Bangladesh.",
                    "The whole lgbt issue is a sensitive topic, I can only provide an anecdote here that in general it seems that most people would just look down on you, as it is a social stigma to be gay there. You may get discriminated from jobs and so on. However if some of the more hardline religious conservatives were to find out, depending on where you are, in the city nothing usually happens but in the rural villages, you may be publicly condemned or even lynched if there are more serious accusations. In many cases a neighbour or relative might try to \"convert\" you to being straight lol.",
                    "I personally don't agree with the intense stigma and violence, that is a societal issue that cannot be easily changed. Violence against the lgbt folks will still result in criminal charges for attackers at least from what I am aware of. You'd be surprised at how nosy people in the rural villages can be. Gossip and rumours goes around quickly. That adds to the problem.",
                    "So while we disagree on LGBT rights, I agree its not the only measure of progressive thought - and honestly, Bangladeshi society would actually riot and have a huge backlash if those steps were taken right now. That being said, internet censorship is increasing, so are crackdowns on freedom of speech. We are developing but our human rights record can definitely be improved. Personally, I'd start with ethnic minorities (there is systemic brutality by the military in the CHT) and try and halt increasing Islamic radicalism. But yeah, stigmas like this take time to get over (even in the US and other Western countries LGBT rights are heavily contested to this day).",
                    "The issue with gay rights here is that throughout human history it was always seen as an abomination, throughout most societies, cultures and religions.",
                    "This is plain wrong.",
                    "Care to explain why that statement is wrong?",
                    "Ok, here's the findings of an ethnographic study on the matter:",
                    "Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. In a 1976 study, Gwen Broude and Sarah Greene compared attitudes towards and frequency of homosexuality in the ethnographic studies available in the Standard cross-cultural sample. They found that out of 42 communities: homosexuality was accepted or ignored in 9; 5 communities had no concept of homosexuality; 11 considered it undesirable but did not set punishments; and 17 strongly disapproved and punished. Of 70 communities, homosexuality was reported to be absent or rare in frequency in 41, and present or not uncommon in 29.",
                    "The study: Gwen J. Broude and Sarah J. Greene, \"Cross-Cultural Codes on Twenty Sexual Attitudes and Practices\", Ethnology, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Oct., 1976), pp. 409–429.",
                    "So only 17 out of 42 different ethnological communities in that study 'strongly disapproved and punished'. The communities studied were drawn from cultures across the world in the Standard cross-cultural sample.",
                    "And the summary of that study I've quoted above is taken from the wikipedia article:",
                    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_homosexuality",
                    "which is worth a scan or a read if you want to learn about the broadly accepted practice of homosexuality across many cultures and societies through history.",
                    "The concept of homosexuality as 'wrong' or a 'sin' is, to my knowledge, most strong in the Abrahamic religions, particularly Christianity and Islam. Those two religions, while having broad uptake and influence across many societies and cultures, are however far from being most religions, nor are they the religion of most societies.",
                    "So I am saying you are flat out wrong with your claim of 'most'. Also, I would caution you against using the word 'abomination' as it is a highly prejudicial word and can spread hate towards and suffering upon people who practice homosexuality or identify as homosexuals. I would hope you don't want to do that.",
                    "Although I believe that homosexuality should not be illegal and that LGBT people should have the same rights as anyone else, this was the correct move on Bangladesh's part.",
                    "The fact of the matter is that Bangladesh is no where near accepting of homosexuality as a society. Not only would Bangladesh approving this aspect of the resolution not be representative of the general feelings of population, but it would lead to more violence against LGBT people in Bangladesh.",
                    "Sooner or later, Bangladesh and many other developing countries will probably adopt measures to give LGBT people equal rights, as they should. I'm thinking in at least 3 or 4 generations though. But as of right now, Bangladesh isn't ready, and it makes no sense for a Bangladeshi delegation to approve something that isn't representative of the interests of the Bangladeshi population.",
                    "Bangladesh don't care about atheists and non-Muslims getting killed but they care about who sleep with who.",
                    "The official also said: “37 countries of the world do not support gay rights and Bangladesh is one of them. Our society is not ready for this yet.”",
                    "According to the latest report, between the years 2013-2017, several lower courts gave the execution orders to 1,119 criminals. However, the High Court stayed the execution of 130 people. Only 17 people were hanged in those five years.",
                    "Sounds like execution is on its way out anyway. I'm not sure what the issue id over societal acceptance of gay rights. There's laws against killing bloggers and society turns a blind eye.",
                    "That or corruption is so damn high that court rulings mean absolutely nothing and you can just skip the death sentence like it's a EA game dlc."

What do you guys think? Is shyleltti a language by itself or is it a dialect of Bengali?",

A lot of them work in taxis, halal carts, shops, stores, home care, and similar jobs. I think a pretty big reason we're ignoring is that Bangladeshi women don't usually get jobs in the U.S. until many years after their husbands find work, and their options are even more limited to lower paying jobs.",
                    "This is key.  Roughly 75% of Bangladeshis in America are foreign-born, which, according to the NCAPIP, is the third highest of any Asian ethnicity in America.",
                    "New York as a hub for Bangladeshi migration also has an impact as majority of its network is based in jobs related to food vending or cab driving, making it harder for those who are newly arrived to get higher paying jobs.",
                    "Most of these folks are immigrants. Immigrants tend to be poor. Also, there isn't much data on US-born or US-raised Bangla, who in my experience (being Bangla myself) tend to make good money and are well educated. There aren't even 200,000 Bangla folk in the country.",
                    "Honestly there prob is more they usually just classify themselves as indian American.",
                    "Yeah, but I think the majority of Bangla not counted for the data will be illegal immigrants, unless I'm wrong.",

I can't make an assessment on things I have no data for, only conjecture, so take anything I say about Bengali-American incomes vs Indian-American ones with some scepticism. We simply don't have enough data about Bangla folk in the US (especially when making comparisons). We can only theorize the reasons behind why we don't have data.",

                    "You can't call the whole study \"bullshit\" because you disagree with one number.  If anything, undocumented Bangladeshis would actually hurt these numbers more.",
                    "If you've noticed Bangladesh is like 8000 miles away from America and it's separated by literal oceans. Very few illegal Bangladeshis are living in America. Not zero. But not enough where they can skew a study that says 188K people.",
                    "You can't call the whole study \"bullshit\" because you disagree with one number.",
                    "You can, if the most important number about the study is plain wrong. This research is suppose to explain Bangladeshi Americans. If it cannot accurately reasonably number the population, how accurate can rest of the data be? Don't forget Pew publishes a research showing some 60 million Muslims are active terrorists.",
                    "Pew is funded by  Evangelical Protestant John Templeton Foundation.  John Templeton is linked with fundamentalist Protestantism.  This foundation is linked to many conservative political moves. This group also funds  Freedom's Watch,  anti-immigrant lobby group group. This group is illegally engaged with National Republican Committee. And Republican, Conservatives, American fundamentalist Christians are generally against immigrants and immigration. And guess who Bangladeshi Americans are---you guessed it---immigrants. Not only immigrants but also Muslim immigrants.",
                    "You gotta be skeptical these days about these things. There's way too many ulterior motives behind way too many things by nefarious forces. What was thought to be laughable conspiracy before turns out to be factual.",

                    "The prime minister’s ICT Affairs Adviser Sajeeb Wazed Joy has launched national call centre ‘333’ which is to provide remedies to social problems being faced by people across the country alongside different government information and contacts.",
                    "“People do not have to come to government offices… We will provide all services to their doorsteps,” Joy said while inaugurating the service at the Prime Minister’s Office on Thursday.",
                    "Officials familiar with the service said people would be able to get 24/7 information services from the number “333” to both mobile phones and land telephones nationwide.",
                    "For overseas users, the call centre can be reached at 09666789333.",
                    "What does that mean? Like what are the exact services? Is this like 911 in the US?",
                    "The UK has gov.uk which basically allows you to do everything online, pay your council tax, apply for student loans, apply for your driver's license, register your vehicle, welfare, pension etc. so this looks to be something similar except on the phone.",

                    "Secondly, her father actually pushed for real socialism which pretty much turned the entire country, especially the elite, against him.  Hasina on the other hand is running a very capitalist government which gives her a chance.  As long as she can keep delivering a good environment for economic growth and prosperity, she can maintain power.  Just like China.",
                    "real socialism",
                    "i have doubts about this. Bakshal was more of a stalinist-maoist approach to regain control of the political sphere imho",

                    "I dont live in bangladesh but whats the deal with her?? Is she even culified? All ive heared from her a very bad things, including murder curroption, and that she actually is a dictator? When is she gonna resing and is she a good ruler? Even though i dont know much about her- i do not like her!",
                    "The reality is that both Zia and Hasina are horrible candidates, and both are highly corrupt. Regardless, it is in the best interests of the country to have Hasina stay in power for at least one more decade to ensure political stability and economic development. No matter how you look at it, it is better to keep one horrible prime minister for a while than to keep switching between two horrible prime ministers.",
                    "However, I do not like Hasina either in the least, but she is a necessary evil we have to maintain.",
                    "I don't know if you should be asking if someone is qualified when you can't seem to manage to spell even one sentence correctly.",
                    "Secondly, if you already don't like her without knowing much about her, that says more about you than it does her.",
                    "Hasina is pulling quite a few undemocratic moves and I have my reservations about them.  But in terms of government performance, this is probably the best Bangladesh has ever had.  We have consistently posted 6%+ growth rates, now over 7%.  Our literacy rate has gone from below 50% to over 72%.  We are doing better in every social indicator.  Corruption, though prevalent, has been reduced.  And the list goes on and on.  Maybe a short term dictatorship isn't such a bad thing.",
                    "Maybe a short term dictatorship isn't such a bad thing.",
                    "At some level, you must realize that you should have stopped before that line.",
                    "The country is making economic progress. But Bangladesh can and must do better. As Bangladesh becomes economically stable, it will face revolution on various other fronts: societal, religious, human rights, etc. I don't know if the current Awami League can handle that.",
                    "Yes, Hasina is better than the alternative. But under Awami League's rule, I expected other more liberal and forward thinking parties to sprout and flourish and eventually move the country forward. But it seems that people who are not submissive to Awami League's leaders end up jailed or get stuck in a legal quagmire.",
                    "At some level, you must realize that you should have stopped before that line.",
                    "I am honestly conflicted about this situation.  I am typically in support of democracy and a believer in peoples right to choose.  But when I see the shit our country went through for the past decades and then see what China and Vietnam has achieved, I start questioning whether developed countries, especially countries that are not well educated, can really function as democracies.",
                    "And the conclusion I am coming to of recent is that maybe I am wrong, and maybe short term dictatorships that transition into democracies once the country is sufficiently developed is the right way to go.  It is what South Korea did and Taiwan did and to an extent what Singapore did as well.  It's not ideal, but who am I to question reality.  And I would always support decisions based on history and reality over what I would theoretically prefer.",
                    "You are correct in many of the points you make. Democracy is a phenomenon that is accomplished by the people, it is of the people and for the people. It cannot be forced, and if the voters are not educated(as in wisdom, not in just literacy) then you risk ending up with mob rule. This might be one explanation for the current state of some countries in the aftermath of Arab spring. The problem is who gets to decide when the population is ready??",
                    "Plus, AL is not simply playing the role of a guiding hand. They are punishing anyone they dislike or one day might challenge them. It's as if they DON'T want the country to grow up so can remain as its caretaker for all eternity. That is something I'm unable to justify or support.",
                    "I think in terms of who gets to decide, we have to trust that the population itself matures at some point and starts to successfully demand it.  It has to be a slow transition but the government can't rule without the support of the people at the end of the day.  Atleast not in a country with a population the size of Bangladesh.",
                    "As for the AL, they are no different than the other successful dictatorships in Asia.  China, Vietnam, even Singapore does this to a certain extent if not greater extent.  And to be honest, I don't think the country can actually grow up until we have a much stronger economy and much higher levels of education.  That will take atleast a decade or two if not more to achieve.",
                    "China, Vietnam, even Singapore does this to a certain extent if not greater extent.",
                    "I can't support injustice because others do it or because it might benefit more people in the long run. That's just wrong. Noone has the right to do that. The minimum standard for being a decent leader is far higher than that. It's would have another thing if they were just stealing money (still very wrong). But they are jailing people, there are disappearances, crossfires, etc. That's monstrous and I cannot condone any of that. The end does not justify the means.",
                    "And to be honest, I don't think the country can actually grow up until we have a much stronger economy and much higher levels of education.",
                    "I think you are right. It would be nice if women's right, worker's rights, and basic human rights grew and matured with the economy as they naturally would. But I fear AL will side with likes of Hefajot if it will get them votes and jail anyone who challenges the status quo because that could lead to AL leaders making less money.",

                    "So what is the alternative?  Economic stagnation?  Constant hartals where 100s would die.  Constant political gridlock?  Allowing fucking terrorists like Jamaat into the government?  Growth of terrorism?  Destruction of minority rights?  Destruction of women's rights?  Destruction of our constitution and institutions?  Ever growing corruption?  Ever increasing crime?  Increasing murder?",
                    "Because that was the reality of Bangladesh for decades.  I am all for standing by principles and holding the moral high ground.  But at a certain point, you have to take a step back and ask yourself, is the alternative worth it?",
                    "Things aren't ideal in Bangladesh right now.  Far from it.  But things have never been ideal in our country.  For the first time, it actually looks like the country is going somewhere that is better than what it used to be.  Where the economy is growing, where education is growing, where infrastructure is actually being built, where we are actually developing.  For once people seem to actually have hope for a better future.  Is the price worth it?  That's for individuals to decide and during the previous election, I was with you completely.  It's not worth it.  But I have to acknowledge the reality on the ground and the fact is that for once, the country is actually developing and chance to realize it's incredible potential.",
                    "EDIT: Just wanted to add, I really appreciate this civil discussion, even if we might not agree, it let's you see other viewpoints which is always beneficial.  I do hope there is more of this in this sub as it is currently very lacking.",
                    "Hey, I know this a 2 month old post. I was extremely busy for couple of weeks after posting this then it just got lost in the shuffle.",

Increasing murder?",
                    "IDK why that has be the alternative. IDK why Awami League cannot be expected to prevent such outcome without blatantly killing, jailing, exiling people who they don't like. This line of logic reminds me of arguments for why women should not vote. Such as, “if women become involved in politics, they will stop marrying, having children, and the human race will die out.” Existing families would fall apart if both parents are allowed to have political opinions, children would roam the streets while the mothers are out voting, etc.",
                    "All I am asking for is the rule of law. Why can't the country progress while abiding by rule of law? I am asking that Awami League govern without killing people. And provide a benevolent guiding hand to its people while they are at it.",
                    "How did chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha get in the way your economic progress? How does the death of Biswajit Das help you cause? (the list is too big to fit here). Would you expect as complacent as to say it's an acceptable loss if they came after you?",
                    "Some crimes are unforgivable, and so is the act of forgiving such crimes. It's not asking too much of Awami League to govern without such crimes.",

The partition was bargained for by Jinnah & Nehru who advocated for countries divided by religious boundaries (Jinnah was particularly adamant about securing a nation for Muslims, who he believed were discriminated against in the subcontinent). Subhash Chandra Bose did advocated for a unified Bengal region, which would have kept the East and West bengal together. But Bose was not considered a mainstream political force in the subcontinental liberation movement since he was considered an extremist. and of course, his untimely death resulted in the unified bengal movement to lose steam.",
                    "The pakistan movement began in Bengal. Its main ideologues were bengali muslims which were overwhelmingly in favor of a seprate nation for muslims.",
                    "I ask you this question because you seem to be a denier of Bangladesh having a muslim identity in any form. The mods here seem to share that belief too.",
                    "you seem to be a denier of Bangladesh having a muslim identity in any form",
                    "I dunno where you got that idea, but let me remind you that the liberation of Bangladesh and its constitution was based on pluralist terms to form a society that would be equal for all religions. Bangladesh has steadily become muslim majority, esp after the re-instatement of Islam as state religion in late 70s and solidified under Ershad's rule. The muslim identity question has only become public recently in the last two decades or so, esp with a bent towards the presumed dichotomy that Islam & Bengali culture are at odds with each other.",
                    "As for other mods, you should probably provide some evidence before making your claims.",
                    "My misunderstanding then, Pardon. Ershad came into power through backing from CIA. The entire muslim world became more islamic oriented during the 80s. Part of a global strategic drive by America against the spread of communist ideals.",
                    "Concerning the decline of hindu population, what makes you believe it was driven by installment of Islam as state religion and not other factors? How did it matter, practically, for the hindu or buddhist minority that Islam was declared state religion?",

                    "Bengali Muslims played a vital role in the birth and growth of All India Muslim league and the eventual partition of India.",
                    "The British found Bengal presidency to be a very difficult province to manage and decided to partition it. Their stand was it would be easier to administer the province as two rather than as one. When the 1905 partition of Bengal took place, most Hindus vehemently opposed the division as a ‘divide and rule policy’, but many Muslims supported it. The Muslim dominated Eastern regions of Bengal presidency had lesser development and infrastructure as compared to the western part. But the political upheaval forced the British to rescind the partition of Bengal and finally the province was reunited in 1911.",
                    "The All India Muslim League was founded in 1906 in Dhaka. The founding meeting was hosted by Khwaja Salimullah, the Nawab of Dhaka. Their reaction was a response to Bengali nationalism for reunification. At that time they were lesser organized than the Bengali elite and couldn’t stop the reunification of the province. Initially, even Mr. Mohammed Ali Jinnah wasn’t an active supporter of a separate state for Muslims in India. But by 30’s many things started to change politically. For a time, Mr. Jinnah didn’t have much say in Congress and leaders of Muslim league like Dr. Allama Mohammed Iqbal appealed to Mr. Jinnah. Bengal had great Muslim leaders who supported separate electorate for Muslims.",
                    "When the Pakistan movement got stronger, the Bengali Muslim leaders also played a strong role, as much as the Punjabi and Sindhi Muslim leaders. The Bengali Muslim league leaders were equally strong in demanding partition. They imagined that the religion would be a unifying factor and language wouldn’t divide them.",

                    "Neither India or Pakistan is a good role model of economical growth although i wish them both prosperity. China, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore are better models to imitate.",
                    "Hate to break it to you, but it is highly unlikely that Bangladesh or even India will ever achieve a GDP per capita equivelant to any Western European nation within our lifetimes. It is the more logical method to compare ourselves with other developing countries like us, like Pakistan, Nigeria, the Phillipines, and Vietnam.",
                    "Why the comparison with pakistan? See nothing good coming from our deep obsession with Pakistan.",
                    "I actually agree with you. But I couldn't resist. Especially since the comparison was already done by a neutral third party and all I had to is just watch it. Let's chalk it up as a guilty pleasure. The only thing I can say in my defense is it's good to see what other developing countries are doing better and learn from them.",
                    "Hahaha. That’s a good point but we always check our ex ‘s status to see how she/he is doing. If she is bad , there’s always a satisfying guilty pleasure 3:)",
                    "Pakistan has its own weakness and strengths. Its a nuclear power and have a strong military designed to defend against numerical superior neighbor. Its economy has stagnated due to fallout from policies starting in the 80’s, in turn triggered by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Compared to the numerous problems Pakistan has done reasonably well. It has prioritized security over economy past 40 years.",
                    "Bangladesh on the other hand have done astonishingly well economically. We began with almost zero industrial base, famine, illiterate population and political turmoil. In the end somehow we managed to beat all the odds and became more developed than what was anticipated.So we have all reasons to be proud.",
                    "In contrast to Pakistan our military is extremely weak and unable to deter Indian and Myanmarese aggression. Thats a huge concern for us right now because India did not behave like a ally when our southeastern neighbor pushed 500 000 of its own citizen into our territory. Bangladesh was totally unable to prevent ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas. A huge embarassment for our security apparatus.",
                    "We have to stop sleepwalking and wake up to the fact that we are isolated in our own neighborhood.",

Yes, our military is weaker than that. As a military enthusiast and with cadet-college background I can say that our military is doing well with the limited budgets and resources. Nothing to worry. Though it seems like we got some hostile neighbors, our diplomats are doing great job to keep up a strong relationship with Bigger powers. By the way video is about “economy” and I guess as a fairly young nation we are doing way better than Pakistan. Secondly, Bangladeshi government was in a very difficult situation about the ‘rohinga’. This is very religious minded country and I think that present government did great job handling that situation.",
                    "Last but not least, outside of our subcontinent, Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani are treated as “Indian”.  So we should not be still fighting and showcasing our powers to each other.",

                    "However, the prime reason why the never ending circle goes on is because  most people of the country are immensely ignorant. 'Sure - let's live - until we don't have to die' - it's like that.",

On the other hand, this sets into the stone the fact that Bangladesh is an undemocratic dictatorship.",

Because effectively any chance of getting any help is practically zero. I won't mind If Bangladesh don't have democracy. But dictatorship in the name of democrasy is bad.  If it's a complete dictatorship. Atleast Bangladesh will be free of student politics and syndicate...",

                    "accountability should go both ways - it's quite sad that the Niko corruption case against Hasina will most probably be dropped.",
                    "Yes but I am looking at this from a purely governmental perspective.  I honestly don't think Bangladesh's population is educated and mature enough to support a democracy (there are many countries that aren't).  We've tried it for decades and all that has happened is we have switched governments every election and started everything from scratch again.",
                    "To truly develop quickly, I am starting to think that you need a well intentioned or at the very least, functioning autocracy.  At least until the country can develop.  This is what happened in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and what is happening in China.",
                    "And this is also what we are starting to see in Bangladesh now.  For the first time in decades, we've had some stability in government, and there has actually been some real development in that time period and the economy is booming.  We need to continue down this path.  And if we are to have an autocracy, at least for the short term, I would rather it be AL instead of Jamaat linked BNP.",
                    "To truly develop quickly, I am starting to think that you need a well intentioned or at the very least, functioning autocracy",
                    "yes but at what cost? what is happenign around the country re: BCL's tyranny on university campuses, the impunity of the AL's members, the police violence, the militarization of the cops, all of these point to the origins of a totalitarian regime.",
                    "real development in that time period and the economy is booming.",
                    "I don't agree with this. The economy is not really booming. See this analysis - https://opinion.bdnews24.com/2017/12/18/where-did-the-benefits-of-economic-growth-disappear/",
                    "it's the usual deal - the inequality in this country is growing. The rich is getting richer, and while yes the middle class has burgeoned and has higher purchasing power, the costs of living in Dhaka, just moneywise are quite high, let alone the externalities (i'm sure you have read about how polluted the city is). Outside dhaka, the environment is ravaged in the name of industrial development.",
                    "Quick development is really no solution - first world nations were able to develop through imperialism and extraction of resources from colonies. In the meantime, they protected their own interests (social security for its citizens, protection for its environments). However, in the post-colonial world, developing nations have been first shackled by IMF and World bank through their aid programs, and later had to enforce neoliberal policies that promise quick GDP growth but at tremendous costs to the residents of those countries.",
                    "I agree that stability in govt is much needed. But I don't agree that an autocractic neoliberal govt is the answer.",
                    "yes but at what cost? what is happenign around the country re: BCL's tyranny on university campuses, the impunity of the AL's members, the police violence, the militarization of the cops, all of these point to the origins of a totalitarian regime.",
                    "Firstly I don't know if that is actually true.  Firstly with regards to the student bodies, student bodies and student politics have always been very active and often violent in Bangladesh.  In the past this has led to many great things such as the language movement and the independence movement, but in the recent past, it has also been very negative and damaging.  But this has not been limited to the chatra league.  In the early and mid 2000s, both the jamaat and bnp student wings were equally active and violent, sometimes more so.  I don't know if you remember the period but there was a time where jamaat student bodies were actively enforcing the hijab, a piece of clothing that really is alien to our culture, on women, across Dhaka.",
                    "Secondly with regards to the militarization of the police, again, i question the timeline being presented here.  If you actually think back, RAB was created under a BNP government and the RAB of 2006 was a lot more powerful and significantly more militarized than the RAB of 2018.  This is not to say that this is not happening, but more that this has been the trend for much longer than the current AL government and has been happening under a democracy.",
                    "it's the usual deal - the inequality in this country is growing. The rich is getting richer, and while yes the middle class has burgeoned and has higher purchasing power, the costs of living in Dhaka, just moneywise are quite high, let alone the externalities (i'm sure you have read about how polluted the city is). Outside dhaka, the environment is ravaged in the name of industrial development.",
                    "Now to the economy, again, citing an opinion piece is just that, it is one view, and to be honest, it is not one I agree with.  As you have said, the upper class has gotten bigger and the middle class significantly bigger.  This is all a sign of a growing economy.  But it isn't just that.  The middle class is coming from somewhere, and in our case, it is coming from reducing the numbers living in poverty.",
                    "If you look at those living in poverty now, during this current AL government from near 40% to just 24%.  data.  With regards to extreme poverty the numbers are even better reducing the rate to just over 12% in 2016.",
                    "All of this is economic progress, in fact fantastic economic progress. Yes inequality is on the rise but that is something that is happening across the world and has happened with any country that is developing throughout history.  It is a product of the global economic system and not just limited to the policies of the Bangladesh government.",
                    "Quick development is really no solution - first world nations were able to develop through imperialism and extraction of resources from colonies. In the meantime, they protected their own interests (social security for its citizens, protection for its environments).

                    "Again I don't agree with this assessment.  Have you ever heard of the great fog of London?  Or the sewers (rivers) of Paris.  We tend to forget how shitty the environment became because developed countries are so clean now and have been for such a long time.  But they have experienced the exact same issues developing countries are facing today in the past.  It's just that they have all or mostly all gotten to a point where they became rich enough to clean up the mess that was made to their environment to a certain degree.  The most recent example of this being South Korea.",
                    "I agree that stability in govt is much needed. But I don't agree that an autocractic neoliberal govt is the answer.",
                    "And finally, like I have said earlier, I don't know if I fully agree with this path myself as I am a big believer in the benefits of a democracy.  The facts and the realities however, especially with the last few decades in Asia, would seem to indicate that well functioning autocratic governments seem to be much more capable at delivering development than poorly educated democracies.  And like we have seen with South Korea and Taiwan, there is nothing preventing us from becoming a democracy again, once the population is sufficiently wealthy and educated.",
                    "Whatever 'stability' we are having at this point is just nothing but giving up our freedom of speech and expression. The student bodies of the ruling party are beating up anyone who opposes them, the police is arresting anyone who is going to the streets. This is totally unacceptable. It is no different than Stalin's USSR or Mao's China. What gives you the assurance that your own daughter or sister wont be be harassed the next day by a ruling party thug, and you can be sure of getting no justice for it. I have zero sympathy for Khaleda Zia. She was in power for 10 years, and she had more than enough chance to establish the rule of law. Her own son tried to kill the leaders of the main opposition party, and she did not stop it. She appointed stupidly corrupt people as her ministers. Whatever Khaleda Zia is facing today is as much as her own fault as it is the current ruling party's.",

What gives you the assurance that your own daughter or sister wont be be harassed the next day by a ruling party thug, and you can be sure of getting no justice for it. I have zero sympathy for Khaleda Zia. She was in power for 10 years, and she had more than enough chance to establish the rule of law. Her own son tried to kill the leaders of the main opposition party, and she did not stop it. She appointed stupidly corrupt people as her ministers. Whatever Khaleda Zia is facing today is as much as her own fault as it is the current ruling party's.",
