                    "The Faroe islands are gorgeous and from what I’ve seen, at least, are filled with wonderful local culture and a strong national identity. But do the Faroese ever feel as if they’re “missing out” on the urban aspects of mainland Europe, or are people generally very happy living there?",
                    "I’ve heard that Faroese people are exceptionally kind and that they also take family ties very seriously. Is this true?",
                    "Also, what is the food scene like? What restaurants do you have there? What is the usual Faroese diet?",
                    "Thank you for doing this!",
                    "do the Faroese ever feel as if they’re “missing out” on the urban aspects of mainland Europe",
                    "This is a difficult one to answer. Yes, I would assume that most miss some of the main stream aspects that you can find in Europe, both in daily life and on a larger scale. With that said though, most students travel to Denmark or other European countries to study, and generally stay there for 3-7 years, after which they move back home. While I will never move home, the people who do so miss the Faroese lifestyle, and are content with living there.  ",
                    "I’ve heard that Faroese people are exceptionally kind and that they also take family ties very seriously. Is this true?",
                    "We welcome people with open arms, whether you're family or stranger. Family is a big part of the Faroese life, and probably even more so in the outer villages, where you're more involved with each other.  ",
                    "What is the food scene like? What restaurants do you have there? What is the usual Faroese diet?",
                    "Most restaurants that you will find will have standard food, which you'll find in most Scandinavian restaurants. However, in Tórshavn you'll find restaurants that focus on faroese food, such as Barbara (fish restaurant), Áarstova (lamb and seafood), etika (sushi) and Ræst (which advertise \"a fermented gourmet experience\"). On top of this we have the world famous Koks restaurant, which I believe still hold a Michelin star. The usual faroese diet is much like the scandinavian, however you'll also see a lot of fish on the table, especially outside of Tórshavn. This often related to most families having fishermen, which can supply a lot of high quality fresh fish.",
                    "Is everybody in a sort of one degree of separation situation?",
                    "What are job opportunities like if a Faroese person wants to stop their career in their 30’s and jump into something completely different?",
                    "What is the best kept secret of the Faroese? The worst kept secret?",
                    "What’s the main thing Faroese complain about regarding tourists?",
                    "What do you most want the rest of the world to know about you as a nation?",
                    "What’s the main thing Faroese complain about regarding tourists?",
                    "I can try to answer this. I believe it's trespassing and hikers getting lost because they didn't check the weather forecast and got surrounded by thick fog - and as a result need to call for emergency help.",
                    "Also with the increase of tourists hikers, we see a negative impact on wild life, but that's something that's being worked on now.",
                    "Yup to the one degree of seperation thing. I’m pretty much guaranteed to have friends in common with any Faroese, even if I’ve never met them before in my life.",
                    "Obs: anecdotal and not irrefutable fact. But likely, seeing as the islands are so small.",
                    "When you say seperation do you mean divorce families. The answer there is that most every classroom as a child with divorced parents. If you simply mean the nation as a whole. Well we here in the north sometimes make fun of the dialect in the south. But as a whole. No",
                    "Well there are limits. Sailing is nearly always open somewhere, though some ships pay better than others. As for on land. There is cutting fish. We have an over abundance of pilots. And engineering and other construction jobs usually have positions. So to answer. It is open outside of pilots and chefs.",
                    "Our best kept secret. The language probably. The worst kept one. That would be whaling. We didn't entirely try to keep it secret but still.",
                    "We complain alot about the trash, its annoying.",
                    "That everything that youve heard about us from the sea sheperd organization is false.",
                    "Oh no not as in divorce, as in degrees of separation, it’s a term, like everyone in the world has 6 degrees of separation, extremely close communities have 1, as in they can get hold of anybody they like since they’re all connected.",
                    "Well yea phone service is available to everyone abd so is 4g.",
                    "And roads go to most places at this point",
                    "Er... not quite the idea, but that’s cool.",
                    "Sorry, im an idiot. I still don't know what you mean",

                    "Most people in the faroes is related in one way or another. When we speak of family in the faroes, we don't stop at our cousins. We include 2nd, 3rd, 4th layer of cousins which in the end leads up to a huge family. In rare cases you even hear people speak of 6th layer of cousin.",
                    "While I don't know at which degree of separation we're at, we're definitively at a lower number than 6.",

                    "Because most jobs in the Faroe Islands are in the capital Tórshavn, they are in the process of building two big new tunnels, one from Streymoy to Sandoy (so you don't have to take the ferry) and one from Streymoy to Eysturoy :)"

                    "So I'm a bit confused as to what a trip to Mykines requires. 1)  How well in advance do I have to book tickets for the ferry/helicopter? and where can I book? I'm a bit worried about booking and then not being able to go, because of weather 2)  I'm a little confused about this guide situation, I know there's an entrance fee, I've read some stuff about how having a guide is required, but others have said that you can just walk around on the set path. How much does a guide typically cost? Is there a way to circumvent that rule. 3) Would it be better to stay overnight instead of returning on the same day? Also I know there's a few hostels in the area, do these also require booking well in advance? 4) Also biggest question, are the Mykines worth it? I know this is the most common destination but I have no i idea if it's worth the hype.",
                    "We visited the island a couple weeks ago so I can clarify a couple of points for you.",
                    "If your only a few people you can generally book the ferry a few days out, but be as early as possible. Book on mykines.fo and helicopter on the atlantic airways site (probably further in advance)",
                    "You don't need a guide, but do need to pay the fee on hiking.fo. There is guides there who will check this as you leave the town.",
                    "We came both ways by ferry on the same day and this was plenty of time to walk to the lighthouse and explore the town with lots of stops. There is a very small hostel + guesthouse so if you are staying I would imagine these need to be booked in advance.",
                    "Absolutely, we had great weather and it was the highlight of the trip",
                    "Helicopter can only be booked one-way, unless you fly out a different day than the way in! So for a daytrip, use the ferry or combine ferry+heli. Especially now, chances are 9/10 that all helicopter seats are booked.",
                    "Mykines is stunning for a good reason. Like Venice, it is superb, but the steady supply of tourists (of which many, sadly, with little understanding of wildlife) does undermine it a little. However, if you take an overnight stay, the island is all yours after the ferry heads back to civilisation.",
                    "Imho, the village alone is worth the trip, but the Holmurin makes it incredible. I know Faroese people who go there as well once in a while, as even for them it is somehwat otherworldly.",
                    "A guided tour to Mykines typically cost between 1200-1500 DKK. You can check out guided tours to Mykines on Guide to Faroe Islands."

                    "I'm planning a 9-10 day solo trip in Faroe Islands in August and I'd like to sleep at the campsites and do some hikes. However, on all the websites I've checked so far, one of the hiking rules mentioned is to never hike on your own. While I understand that it's a general advice everywhere in the world, is there anything specific about hiking conditions in Faroes that could make it more dangerous? I suspect part of the problem is the weather, mostly the wind I guess? Which might be dangerous on exposed trails. I'll add that I'm not a newbie to hiking, I also have some experience in hiking in Iceland, which I imagine might be somehow similar.",
                    "Sudden thick fog is an issue. If this happens, sit down and call 112. No hiking expert, so maybe someone can elaborate further. One very good practice, if you go alone, is telling people “I’m going hiking here, I’ll be back at X pm, if not, call for help”",
                    "Thank you for your answer! Your advice to tell somebody about my itinerary is a good one. The problem with it is that I plan to move between the campsites and therefore won't come back to the same place most of the time.",
                    "Ideally go sit by a cairn (varði in Faroese). These will be dotted all along any remotely established hiking route and will make you easier to find if that becomes necessary.",
                    "There aren’t that many camp sites on the Faroes. Not that you’re not getting 9-10 days of hiking done, but pitching a tent on someones property can lead to shitty experiences. As a rule, you should get the owners permission beforehand. This is one of the few cases where I don’t advice “it’s easier getting forgiveness than permission”. 95% of the landowners will give you permission.",
                    "Thank you, I will keep that in mind. I will try to stick to the designated camp sites.",
                    "Www.camping.fo lists all campsites.",
                    "Some hikes can be dealt with on your own, but those aren't generally the ones you've come for or see in the pictures. Other hikes are ok because so many others do it as well so you will never be completely alone.",
                    "It's not only the weather, it's also the mossy terrain that is full of holes and slippery rocks. Faroese terrain is full of them. It frequently happens that a tourist (and locals too) sprains an acle or worse. In those situations you're completely on your own and perhaps not even visible for the rescue helicopter.",
                    "Doable hikes:",
                    "Klaksvík hike (view over Kalsoy and Kunoy).",

                    "Kalnes on Kalsoy is getting so popular that it becomes safer and safer to handle alone. I did that anyway.",
                    "Short hikes in the vincinity of almost all villages. Villages generally (with notable, severe exceptions) are situated in the easier terrain of an isle.",
                    "Some old virtually disused roads are also good and safe hiking grounds, such as to Múli (requires back-tracking), Hvannasund-Viðareiði and Lopra-Sumba. Also nice: the unused road to abandoned Søltuvík, Sandoy. Np traffic here beyond the odd sheep owner. Also Gjógv-Funningur/Eiði doesn't get too much traffic, not annoying at least.",
                    "In general, however, I think you can meet likeminded hikers as in most hostels and camp sites, to team up with for the day.",
                    "Some hikes really, really require company if you are a normal person caring about safety. Those are obviously hikes that pass mountain ridges, with a lot of metres up and down, often through unconnected valleys with poor cellphone reach where only sheep come.",
                    "Yeah the Faroes are wet and slippery. It's possible to get badly hurt by falling, and calling for help is hard if you're alone, have broken or sprained something, and there's bad cell phone connection. Or worse you could have hit your head and be alone and unconscious in the mountains.",
                    "There are many people who have just up and vanished in the Faroese mountains.",
                    "So you're taking some pretty serious chances by going alone on routes that are not frequently traveled or that are not visible from villages or roads.",
                    "Thank you very much, this is very informative and exhaustive. I will take all your advice into account and reconsider my plans, maybe I will reduce the hiking part and do more sightseeing.",
                    "/u/kalsoy might disagree with me, but if you are an experienced hiker most of the trails will be of no issue (weather permitting). I wouldn't tell you to reconsider your plans, rather have multiple ideas/itineraries in place for any given day just in case bad weather is present. I would argue the ones shown in the most well-known pictures can absolutely be done alone.",
                    "IF you are careful, have common sense, and have hiked many times before, I don't think many hikes are off the table. The well-known ones are doable. While he put a question mark on Nolsoy, I have hiked that one and would say it is much simpler than the main trail on Kalsoy. One constant worry is the edges of the islands, the cliffs. As a hiker/backpacker myself, I implore you to not \"reduce\" the hiking part unless absolutely necessary.",
                    "Fyi, I will be back in August of this year, the 6th to the 15th. Feel free to come on some hikes with me, I will probably (possibly?) be doing the long one around the island of Vagar.",
                    "Thank you very much for your advice and all the information, as well as your kind offer. I will consider my plans and let you know (tbh I’m not even sure about my travel dates yet.)",
                    "So as usual, the matter boils down to personal preparation and experience. It seems that I’ll still have to do some more research to decide which trails I am suitable for. But since it’s gonna be my first time in Faroe Islands, I actually don’t mind doing less hiking than I initially intended and more of seeing the towns and villages, as long as I still get to walk a couple of nice trails with interesting views. But I surely won’t push it alone on any difficult hikes or in dubious weather."

                    "I'm also hoping to capture the northern lights & astrophotography if the weather allows.",
                    "What temperatures/weather conditions are normal for this time of year? I'm expecting temps arounnd 5 degrees C and potentially some snow. This isn't really an issue for me as long as hiking/driving is still possible.",
                    "Dude, weather forecasting so far ahead is impossible, it could be snowing, it could be foggy, it could be snowy but the sun is shining and no clouds, it could be -10c it could be 5c, it could be windy and rain is hammering you in the face from the side",
                    "Oh I know, I'm not looking for a forecast. Just what the typical climate is like in February and if it dramatically affects hiking/driving.",
                    "Driving is fine but I would not recommend hiking personally during feburary. And the weather is unpredictable, so you have to go day by day. I can't remember which months, but it was snowing a lot this winter.",

                    "My suggestion is to make sure you can get to the places you want to photograph via car. Some places are only accessible by boat or helicopter. Tide schedules are available at visitor centers so check for the timing of those when you plan to drive certain places too.

Is it possible to return the tickets I got from hiking.fo or should we take the risk with coming back from mykines by ferry",

It isn't cheap, but there are also many destinations that cater to budget tourists.  I think a visitor to the Faroes gets what they pay for.  Breathtaking scenery and the freedom to wander endlessly with almost zero crowds.  I've been several times and the longest line I've waited in was at the grocery in Torshavn.  Regardless, when I said \"resources\" I wasn't referring to only money.  That leads to...",
                    "Driven: Motivation, ingenuity, resiliency, and fortitude are all resources as well.  These are qualities that a visitor to the Faroes should have because it isn't a polished and easy destination that lays everything out at your feet.  You have to go get it, and that isn't easy in a tiny chain of islands in the middle of the North Atlantic.  But it shouldn't be easy, otherwise it would be trampled by tourist hordes the same way Iceland has been.  For the visitor who can plan accordingly, listen to the advice that locals are more than happy to provide, spend some real time researching and learning about the place, and bounce back when things don't go as planned, the Faroes is a truly incredible place.",
                    "Flexible: Of course it's impossible to plan around the weather in the Faroes, but proper planning means taking into account the erratic weather and having a backup plan if needed.  Bad weather and all the delays and cancellations that come with it should be taken in stride.  Otherwise, it causes blame to be hurled in the wrong direction out of pure frustration.  I've had many flight cancellations and delays, but I understand that such a thing is a very real possibility when traveling to that part of the world.",
                    "So yes, that sentence sums up almost perfectly.  Anyone who wants an inexpensive, easy, and predictable vacation can quickly find hundreds of options that are perfect for them.  Everyone else who is ok with a more expensive trip that requires more research and may not go exactly as planned will have an amazing time here.",
                    "Or they could just, you know, improve the helicopter availability.",
                    "Good idea!  Now tell me who's going to pay for it.  You?  Helicopter transportation is already heavily subsidized.  Should the Faroese government just reach into their magic bag of unlimited funds and foot the bill for more flights?",
                    "At this point, I'm not even sure what your point is anymore.  Do you want to open the Faroes up to mass tourism so it can turn into Iceland 2.0?  Do you want the roads clogged with ignorant tourists who simply stop their rental car in the middle of the road to take pictures?  Do you want plastic bottles and food containers to outnumber the birds on Mykines?  You seem to love the idea of a version of the Faroes where all the complicated tourism logistics are worked out and paid for by the government, but you haven't taken a second to consider what that might look like in the long run.",
                    "My point is just that a lot fewer people would leave disappointed if they had more helicopter availability (and they could charge for it, I don’t care).",
                    "But it’s pointless to argue because it sounds like you actually want people to leave the Faroe Islands disappointed, which is weird. But whatever. Maybe you can sit at the airport and turn people away if they aren’t good enough for you.",
                    "Of course I don't want people to leave disappointed.  However, as I've said a couple times already, I don't want traveling to the Faroes to be as easy as a lot of other places that have become overrun by tourists as a result.  I think you may recognize that phrase, assuming you've been reading my posts.  I'm aware of very many people who leave the Faroes disappointed anyway.  Do you?  It seems like you're arguing for a solution to a problem that is mostly made up by you.",
                    "Have you thought about staying the night? The island is infinitely more special after the last ferry has left.",
                    "Indeed, a few of the cabins on Mykines are also available on Airbnb.   Just don't be expecting lavish accommodations.",
                    "I think that goes for Mykines in a nutshell!",
                    "How would we go about staying the night is there a hotel or anything of the sort, I've heard the island is quite small",
                    "There's Kristianshús which is a hostel there, not sure of contact details. From my last knowledge there's a bed and breakfast there ( http://www.magenta.fo/en/mykines-2/). It's all simple accommodation, you're not going to get anything above 2 star. But having the tranquillity is worth a prolonged stay.",
                    "Thank you I will look into it",
                    "If you can't manage any other options, sunset with the puffins and sheep is pretty fun. Hope you enjoy the faroes.",
                    "You can reserve by email, but just showing up also works fine. It's a nice, odd place and cheap too. I spent two nights (boarlt in, heli out) and loved it. The evenings are special indeed.",
                    "Last time I needed to contact them, Kristianshus was pretty response on Facebook, of all places.  https://www.facebook.com/Kristiansh%C3%BAs-Guesthouse-Mykines-850672731666852/",
                    "I didn't stay there, but did enjoy a light meal.  http://offbeateats.org/2016/11/kristianshus-mykines-faroe-islands/"

                    "Hi,we've just booked our tickets to fly to the Faroe Islands beginning of August (5th to 13th) - now it's time to start looking at rental cars. I've read road conditions are overall very good - would there be any reason not to pick the smallest (cheapest) model they have? We're pretty much going to be based out of Thorshavn and do day-trips to the most known sightseeing spots (Mykines, Vestmanna, Gasadalur, Saksun, Gjorgv, etc.). Thanks!",
                    "When we went we had a Suzuki Vitara, but that was only because there was 4 of us with luggage. I would go for a compact personally if it was just two of us so there is a bit of room, not a sub-compact, but that's up to you. We didn't travel on any rough terrain really, except for maybe one road but any car could handle it I would say.",
                    "I had a fairly cheap Citroen Cactus and it handled just fine. The roads are great, the only time you aren’t on a nicely paved road is in some of the tunnels and also the roads to a few of the hikes are just dirt and loose rocks, but we had no issues.",
                    "I rented the same vehicle last December - I had no issues with road conditions at all.",
                    "A lot of the companies list the lowest prices for the smallest cars, however they actually dont have this size available and you'll therefore get a free upgrade.",
                    "We are using a VW Polo from Unicar and we’ve had an amazing experience! Occasionally there’s a gravel road that feels a bit sketchy to go over but mostly totally fine. Excellent road conditions. Best deal we could find and great customer service.",
                    "4x4 is absolutely a waste of money - even a one-wheel-drive car would do the trick, cause the roads are superb and never too steep."

                    "Hi all, We are planning a trip to Faroe Islands. We would leave on the 26th of September in the morning. I was wondering if there are any rooms or local b&b we can book, near the airport, instead of hotels? I looked at Airbnb but there was only one or two options. On the visit Faroe Islands website there seems to be quite a few options, but no websites or emails are mentioned.",
                    "Thanks in advance!",
                    "There’s not really anything by the airport. We stayed at an Airbnb only 10-15mins away. Have you tried that?",
                    "15 minutes by car or by foot?  I'm just not sure how to get to the airport by 6am.",
                    "Car. Are you flying out of Vagar? It’s kind of isolated. We stayed overnight in the next little town over. It was pretty inexpensive. Rented a whole house for 110$ USD a night. Cozy and comfortable.",
                    "Thanks very much!",
                    "Everybody usually stays in Tórshavn the night before an early flight. Just get up early and take the morning bus :)",
                    "Oh that's definitely a possibility! Any details for the bus? Timetable, location and prices? Thanks a lot!",
                    "First bus looks like it leaves Torshavn at 5:50 am which might not be too good. I was there last week and used Bil Taxi (http://taxi.fo/en/). They were really good and charge a fixed price per person to the airport. Think they have an app as well.",
                    "That's very much appreciated. How long is the bus? I'm guessing since there aren't many flights, arriving anytime before 7 am should be fine. How long did security take you?",
                    "5:50 bus will get you to the airport for 6:35 and goes from the ferry terminal. It only runs mon-fri though. If you're going at a weekend the first bus is an hour later. Security takes no time at all - we arrived an hour before takeoff at the airport, checked in luggage, went through security and still had loads of time before boarding.",
                    "That's awesome. We only have hand luggage so should be even quicker. Our flight is mid-week so we'll probably just take the bus! Thank you for your kind help.",
                    "No problem - have a great trip!",
                    "Check www.SSL.fo/en, route 300 for the timetable. Buses depart from the ferry terminal in Tórshavn and stop at SMS and along the highway leading north as well. Tickets onboard, either cash or by debit card. I think it was 80 DKK per person.",
                    "Thanks!",
                    "How do you plan to get around the islands the rest of your trip? I rented a car and it was relatively inexpensive for all of the freedom you get with it. Just a consideration :) Also, check in and security takes only a few minutes. There are only 2 gates at the airport and if you are only bringing hand luggage, security will go quickly. Have a great trip!!",
                    "That's awesome! We do have a car but we have to return it the night before.",
                    "Oh bummer! Maybe try extending it through the morning? I imagine the extended price will be cheaper than the price of a taxi and stress of making sure you get there on time. Just a thought.  Ugh I’m jealous! I want to go back to the land of two-way, one lane streets!",
                    "There are plenty of those here in England! I am happy to recommend if you want!",
                    "Still haven’t been to England! It is on my list but I don’t know that London is...I want to explore beautiful countryside instead.",
                    "London is great (where I reside). But if you have time, I'd recommend one or more of the following places: The lake district, Cornwall, Wales, and of course Scotland (Edinburgh and the Lochs)."

We won't be arriving until late at night so we'd be available from the 31st through the 8th. We'll be spending the first couple of days exploring Tórshavn and the surrounding area, then we'll be hiking the other areas of the islands after. We'll be spending every night in the capital, though, in an Airbnb, so if anyone would like to meet up and hang out, maybe have a beer or two, that would be really cool! I'd especially love it if you could teach us a bit of Faroese or about the local cuisine :)",

It’s breathtakingly beautiful here and there is so much to see and do. Cheers and let me know if you have any further questions!",

                    "Hi all, I am a German medical student. During the first two years of studies, an internship in care/nursing activities are part of the curriculum. I would very much like to do this internship in the Faroe Islands. As the Tórshavn and Klaksvík hospitals already declined my request, I would like to apply in Tvøroyri on Suðuroy. As I do not know whether Faroese hospitals are used to such internships, it would be great to know somebody who works in that hospital as a personal contact might help with such an application. Does anyone know somebody who works in Tvøroyri’s hospital? As nursing interns are supposed to do very basic work, they can provide real help already within relatively short internships (1 month). This is why German hospital accept nursing interns very willingly. Payment is not needed (and not common in German hospitals). Best wishes from Germany!",
                    "Unpaid work is totally uncommon and I’ve never heard about that on the Faroes. We also are a civilised country with very strong workers unions, and unpaid work is not on any of their agendas in any way possible. You may want to leave that particular part out your application, as any HR manager on the Faroes would treat a paper with those words on them like any other piece of trash that ends up in the bin.",
                    "there's been plenty of it, but it requires a work permit just like paid work, so that's where the problem is for most employers. However, there have been volunteers working in the Faroes in different fields, it's not that unheard of. Internships in the medical sector could be difficult to come by because of a difference in the education system maybe. But that's just my guess..."

I'm a uni student of linguistics who's very interested in the Faroese language, and I'll be one of the students at the Faroese Summer Institute with the University this August. Was just wondering if anyone else is going this summer, as I'm a little worried about going and knowing no one (though I suppose that's part of the experience).",

The one thing in this world that i know i love is Scandinavian language and history so i thought i might as well go to school to learn more and get a degree in that field of study.",

                    "I've always been told that virtually all Faroese, young and old alike, are fluent in Danish. As such, being Swedish (but fluent in Danish, though I speak it more clearly than Danes), I had zero qualms about conversing with locals in it during my short holiday in the Faroes (Midvágur and Tórshavn).",
                    "While almost all people I spoke to were indeed fluent (with most speaking rigsdansk), I came across a young bus driver (slightly older than me) on line 300 who appeared to genuinely struggle to speak the language (for example he didn't seem to know the word \"student/studerende\", instead saying \"lésandi\" - though I understood it, as I understand a significant amount of Faroese in general).",
                    "I can perfectly understand why this would be the case; I doubt most people, especially outside Tórshavn, get that much active practice in Danish in everyday life. It just goes against what I've read online and heard from others.",
                    "So my matter-of-fact question is: next time I'm going to really isolated places such as Fugloy and remote parts of Suduroy.",
                    "Should I then make sure to simplify my vocabulary and speak extra slowly when conversing with locals (I absolutely can do this, but just want to be aware)? Does it vary between age groups?",
                    "I don't know if people in Tórshavn are better at Danish. The elderly are maby not as good at pronunciation as younger people, because of the old ways of learning Danish(Gøtudanskt). I think it mostly depends on whether the person consumes more or less Danish media, or if the person has been living in Denmark. As for simplifying your vocabulary, I think it can be seen as a little condescending by some. I would just speak properly and then if someone has a hard time understanding you, maby you can try to simplify. But that's just my take on it.",
                    "If you don't follow Danish media, doesn't that mean you don't really follow much at all?",
                    "There is other other media to consume other than Danish. Kringvarp Føroya (kvf.fo) is the national radio and television, which is in Faroese. A lot of people watch NRK, which is the Norwegian national radio and television. And in the age of internet most people watch all sorts of American and other international news.",
                    "[removed]",
                    "Why this insufferable know-it-all bot?",
                    "Mind that a matter of pride and stubborness may in place, too. Some locals simply want you to understand Faroese as they feel that they had been forced to speak Danish, and now the tides are turning. If they make an effort understanding Danish, Danish people should not be surprised to make an effort too. This is not always a consciously made decision though, many simply do not realise that they mix up words.",
                    "Also mind that most parts of the countryside outside Tórshavn is part of Tórshavns \"urban system\", with many thousands commuting to the capital for work or school every day. Even from Suðuroy it's commonplace to have a second home or room to stay in during working day nights. Buying a house in a village while working elsewhere is quite common, so there is no simple line between Tórshavn and the rest. This makes it extremely hard to state any conclusions on whether people speak better Danish here or there.",
                    "Even kids from outer islands have travelled around, learned 'proper' Danish in school, and watch Danish television. So rather than a regional thing, it's a blend of a tad of nationalism and a generational thing.",
                    "I must say I truly admire and even envy the nationalism of the Faroese. Although you may not agree with my views, I truly, truly hope you don't suffer the same fate as my country, with \"förortssvenska\" becoming commonplace even among native Swedes (who think it's \"cool\"!!!) and regard it as a dialect rather than a mixture of broken Swedish and other languages.",
                    "You're absolutely right to want people to know the local language, at least if planning to live there. I could actually imagine settling down there (preferably somewhere remote but with a bus line) after I've finished my education, and would make sure to become fluent in Faroese ASAP first thing I do.",
                    "(yes, I'll admit it out loud: after my short visit, I think I'm in love with your country)",
                    "I must say, objectively, that Faroese (and even Götudanskt) sounds so much more beautiful than (standard) Danish :D I honestly wish I could speak it (I do understand many things when eavesdropping on locals - including everything one tourist office worker said during a phone call to someone else - but I myself sadly only know a few phrases)",
                    "On-topic: great info, thanks!",
                    "Yeah I would advise against simplifying your Danish unless the person you're talking to is struggling to understand you. It will come off as condescension. We village people may not have as fancy clothes as those \"big city\" Havnafólk, but we're no less intelligent or educated.",
                    "Danish is taught in school as a second language, though from an early age, so most people have had it as a school subject for 7 years or so, and are perfectly sufficient. But there are always a few people who have a hard time in school for whatever reason, my guess is that applies to the bus driver you speak of.",
                    "We village people may not have as fancy clothes as those \"big city\" Havnafólk",
                    "Wtf even is this. We all wear the same kind of clothes?",
                    "It is an attempt at satire. I was trying to depict an exaggerated stereotypical \"bygdafrell\".",
                    "I guess I failed.",
                    "Young people tend to be a bit more proficient in both Danish and English than older people, but afaik everyone has a good enough understanding of danish to where they can ask you to simplify or they will understand you if you were to ask them whether or not you should simplify.",
                    "IMO it's hard to make a general statement so i would just go in assuming that they speak proficient danish, even outside the larger cities and towns it is the norm to be able to communicate in danish while those who can't are outliers.",
                    "Basically just be a bit attentive, if they seem to be struggling you can simplify but don't expect this to be the case especially in the service/tourism industry.You are also absolutely right regarding the danish ability degrading due to lack of use, many of my friends from the faroes went to technical or business gymnasiums which mean they don't have to take danish classes, and their danish has clearly degraded quite a bit. But then again they are all completely fluent in english."

My girl when she order online always put the country as  Denmark but the rest is in Faroe Island. But even after knowing that I’m still worried that it wont arrive in her house because of the country i put in is Denmark. So what do you guys think about this? I need as many opinion as i can get.

                    "My fiance and I are having a small destination wedding in Faroe Islands this September.  I have already given her the ring but she would still like for me to get something engraved on it.  I was looking up ideas but everything in English seems kind of plain and a little cheesy.  I like some of the French sayings but I thought it would be a little more special and relevant to get something in Faroese on it.  Would anyone mind helping me out by translating a few sayings to Faroese for me?  I would greatly appreciate it!  We are very excited to come visit in September!",

My friend who went with me is turning 50 this year and I wanted to make her a bracelet out of the 50 øre coins. I kept them out for so long but now am moving and they got packed away. So, I’m in a bind. I’m in search of 2 or 3 of these coins in decent condition (good enough so you can read the 50). Does anyone know where I can get 3 of these to the US? I will pay for shipping or whatever I need. I’m desperate.",

When finished, the tunnel between Tórshavn and Sandoy will be started with. They have already suggested a third tunnel between Sandoy and Suðuroy be built afterwards, but this would require a 27 km (?) two-tubed tunnel, incredibly expensive. I once asked the Minister of Transport if, when the Sandoyartunnil is finished, the ferry from Tórshavn to Tvøroyri/Suðuroy could start sailing from Sandoy to Hvalba/Suðuroy, which would reduce sailing distances by 50% and thus offer twice as many trips per day.

The current route via Tórshavn is sufficient for the ultra low demand. And the existing ferry to Suðuroy is already unprofitable, government-subsidized, so why add a competing link? Also regionally and culturally the two isles are unconnected. Interaction in terms of migration for instance is limited. So only a handful of tourists would use a Sandoy-Suðuroy service, whereas it needs hundreds of paying passengers per week to turn them cost-effective...",
                    "Because so many Suðuroy people work in Tórshavn, and not a single one in Sandoy (I checked the statistics, see my thesis), going via Sandoy would increase the hassle a lot. Their two hour napping time would be reduced to one hour, with an uncomfy trip by bus or car for the final leg of the trip. At present, Suðuroy people often leave their car on Suðuroy as they can manage all distances in Tórshavn on foot/by bus, which saves a fortune over time. Plus, when the ferry terminal is in town, you don't need much spare time to make sure you don't miss the ferry. The farther away the terminal, the more can go wrong underway, the more spare time you'd need.",
                    "A ferry route between Sandoy (Sandur) and Suðuroy (Hvalba?) would require one or two new ferry terminals.

                    "The seas between Sandoy and Suðuroy are quite uncomfortable. Often full of currents, gusts and eddies. It would make the timetable tide-dependent, no one likes that when your work or school starts at 9 and finishes at 17 o'clock. The Tórshavn-Tvøroyri route on the other hand sails in the \"shadow\" of these eddies, gusts and currents. Much more comfy.",
                    "Last but not least: the minister, from Suðuroy himself, likes how \"his\" big ferry docks in Tórshavn 2-3 times a day, sailing inches away past the Prime Minister's windows, reminding him and Tórshavn of Suðuroy's presence. To move the ferry to Sandur on Sandoy, in the \"middle of nowhere\", feel like an insult.",
                    "Until 1993 all Sandoy ferries departed from Tórshavn. As you can imagine, it added 30 mins (for Skopun) to 1 h (to Sandur) to the total ferry time. The current Sandoy ferry terminal has reduced travel times significantly and as a result the same ferry can make three times as many trips per day. Combined with other projects (Vágar tunnel, 2002; Kollafjørður tunnel, 1992) the current situation is a very major improvement. The port is too small however for Suðuroy's beast and the isle of Sandoy lies in the way, meaning zero travel time gain if the Suðuroy ferry were to depart from here as well.",

A land tunnel is also easier to maintain than a winding mountain road when it comes to winter servicing. However, only in times of plenty, the upfront investments are doable. When the 1990s crisis stroke, many projects were postponed or cancelled. The ferry port to Sandoy was perhaps the only project to be finished during the crisis.",

Almost all islands are Tórshavn-oriented, and interaction between regions is limited to neighbour-to-neighbour. Since Sandoy and Suðuroy lack a direct link since the 1950s, they have grown apart.

                    "Denmark doesn't own the Faroe Islands, it is a former colony of Denmark. Today, the Faroe Islands is a semi-autonomous nation within the kingdom of denmark, where domestic matters are largely settled locally.",
                    "The Faroe Islands (population: ~50,000 mind you) rely on Denmark for some services, that are not feasible to set up from scratch for such a small population (military, health care, police etc.) and Denmark get to keep a vestige of their former colonialism along with influence in north atlantic matters, in conjunction with a similar arrangement with Greenland. Denmark thus maintains a military and political presence in the North atlantic, and is considered a major player in north atlantic/artctic matters.",
                    "Pretty sure health care is taken care of locally. Denmark has the police, large parts of foreign policy and immigration.",
                    "True, but they still rely on Denmark for education, training and special equipment/treatments to some degree. It's definitely not as simple as I put it above, but I figured that I should leave it at that for the sake of brevity.",
                    "yeah they do rely on danish personnel to some extend, simply because it's hard to find educated doctors in the Faroes, and everyone understands Danish. There's certain procedures that can't be done in the Faroes, so patients are moved to mainly Iceland or Denmark. Otherwise the health sector is pretty independent... You don't need to go to Denmark to get a degree as a doctor, you can go anywhere as long as the education is recognized. I don't disagree with what you're saying, just wanted to point out that the health sector is more of a voluntary partnership with some danish institutions than something Denmark has actually any control over. :)",
                    "No. 1: The Faroes were never a colony. It used to be a tax-tributary country to the Norwegian Crown and Faroese officials swore allegiance to the Norwegian Crown until the Dano-Norwegian Twinned Realms were sundered, whereupon the Faroes became personal property of the former Dano-Norwegian king, who remained king of Denmark, at this point the Faroes held the status of a county (amt) and was incorporated into the Danish Realm in 1852 when the Constitution of the Unitary Realm of Denmark was introduced in the Faroes - Home Rule was attained in 1948 and was expanded in 2005.",
                    "No. 2: The Unitary Realm of which the Faroes are a part does not recognize the Faroese as a people, therefore they cannot be a nation - as this would be in conflict with both the stipulations of the Home Rule Act and the Constitution.",
                    "Denmark feels ashamed for their colonial history, or at least somewhat responsible, and kind of uses the Realm as a way to compensate the (mostly healed) harm. It also realises that a 50,000 state needs a good friend to survive. Bundle powers. Sometimes marriage is the best way to settle a good relationship, right? Even if it isn't for love but for saving money on a combined budget overall. Yes, that divorce is always a risk in such relationships, but as long as all works out, it's fine.",
                    "This whole reasoning of colonialism is mainly true for Greenland, but since the two colonies share a common past and certain common characteristics (fisheries, small nation, limited local brainpower, political status), what counts for Greenland should also count for Faroe.",
                    "One difference with Greenland is that Greenland is costing the Danes a lot more (a factor ten, minimum). But, with so many mineral resources, the odds for cash back are - hypothetically - higher. Faroe on the other hand doesn't cost much and won't deliver much.",
                    "For many average Danes, the Faroe Islands aren't even on their radar, but as long as it doesn't hurt them (financially), why alter things?",
                    "Tl;dr: history.",
                    "The geopolitical arguments that others said are also legit, but imho a little less important.",

That is a big market for such a tiny country.",

Is it true you now must hire a guide for this hike and it's only accessible on certain days of the week? I'm curious because I dont see how this is enforcible not to mention the \"guided\" hikes all begin at noon time which is much later in the day then myself and my group had planned on going. Obviously we want to respect the rules but we can't seem to find official answers. Thanks for your help!",

The trip is self planned and there are no agencies or guides involved, I just want to explore the islands, enjoy the landscape and take some nice pictures. I also asked for some advice in /r/Travel, but thought I'd better to ask the important questions here, now that I've found your subreddit:",
                    "SEASON / I will be there from April 25th to May 1st: while I know what to do (I prepared a rough planning), I couldn't find info about seasonal changes in ferry lines, roads, other things which could be not available in April. Any idea on where to look?",
                    "HIKES / Which are the excursions or hiking trails I could not know about but you highly recommend? I only have a week, so I wouldn't spend a whole day in the same place, but a couple hours of trekking are always good.",
                    "MOBILE DATA / though I'd prefer to completely disconnect from the world for a week, I might need a mobile Internet connection sometimes and with my Italian SIM the costs are just insane outside the EU (in Fær Øer I'd spend 4,5 DKK every 100KB, plus I'd have a lower data cap). Is there a way (possibly a fast / cheap one) to get a feroese SIM as soon as I hit the land? At the airport maybe? Or in Torshavn? Would it be complicated for me as a foreigner?",
                    "TRIP TO MYKINES / What's the most comfortable way to get to the island and back the same day? I tried to book a helicopter trip but the website says the outbound day must be before the return day. I'd like to do a one day excursion.",

                    "It means all seats are sold out. \"No tours available\". The booking engine has an English version (top right corner, UK flag) which may help. Something you may want to consider is to click the SMS thing, which puts you on a waiting list. If someone cancels, a seat becomes available.",
                    "Thank you. The way helicopters work is a bit confusing to me, since it looks you're forced to choose a different return date even if your destination is an inhabited island like Stóra Dímun. Anyway, it's not a problem at all, there are other great things to see.",
                    "Anyway, since you're so kind, I'd like to ask you about this timetable. I'd really like to visit Fugloy and it must be a single day trip, since I only have a week. I know ferries can't be booked in advance, so I'll just buy tickets at the terminal. But to me the way routes and times are displayed is once again really confusing.",
                    "Are the ferries making the trips every day (and multiple round trips per day)? I assumed I can embark in Hvannasund, disembark in Kirkja or Hattarvík, walk around on the island and wait for the next passage of the boat so I can go back to Hvannasund. Did I get it right?",
                    "Also, I really can't understand this note. It should mean every Monday, but why a double T?",

                    "Yeah, that's exactly the point! The service is intended for local people only, but because they can't ban foreigners from using it (law states that everyone is equal), they made it unattractive for tourists. The Faroese government pays a lot of tax money to make the helicopter cheap for its own citizens, not for cheap-ass tourists (like me back then) that \"steal\" all the 12 seats.",
                    "so I'll just buy tickets at the terminal.",
                    "There is no terminal. Just walk onto the ferry, pick a seat, relax and wait until the ticket salesguy comes to  you for payment. You only pay for the outbound journey, the inbound return is free.",
                    "The ferry sails a long route: Hvannasund-Svínoy-Kirkja-Hattarvík*-Svínoy-Hvannasund, three times a day (x = all weekdays, 6 = Saturday, 7 = Sunday), with a super early morning tour on day 1 (Monday) and day 3 (Wednesday) that needs to be reserved in advance (T).",

                    "So there's your answer, but it was also on the website: \"T) By request on tel. 29 31 05 or 29 31 18 the latest two hours before departure. For morning trips, however, at the latest before 8pm on the day before.\"",
                    "*Mind this: The ferry stops in Hattarvík only on request. Getting off is easy: simply tell the ticket salesman onboard your destination and he'll make the captain sail via Hattarvík. The way back is trickier: either phone the boat well in advance, or tell the ticket salesmen that you want to be picked up in Hattarvík again with the 14:45 or 18:30 ferry (which stops in Hattarvík at 15:40 or 19:20). It is easier to gett off in Hattarvík, then walk to Kirkja, where the departure is 100% guaranteed (unless storms rise).",

                    "So the boat stops in Hattarvík on request but it stops in Kirkja by default?",

                    "Yeah, I want to take the car with me to Suðuroy only, just to explore a little more.",
                    "So, at this point I'd like to ask you one more question: my trip plan is kinda ready (it's a rough one, I like to leave space to improvisation). Here on Reddit I received a lot of good feedback and advice, but you're probably the most competent guy. So, if you had few days like me and you was forced to choose just 3/4 things you wouldn't absolutely miss, which would they be? I mean waterfall, lakes, cliffs, villages, anything.",
                    "Thanks again for your help.",
                    "You could still try to use the helicopter to go to Suðuroy or Klaksvík, or from Vágar to Tórshavn, just for the fun of flying in a helicopter. Take the normal public transport back, I did that and it works perfectly. Especially the flights between Tórshavn and Klaksvík are good, as no local ever uses this stretch, so tourists are welcome. Take bus #400 for the outbound / return journey :)",
                    "Credit cards: not sure, but normal debet cards yes. And cash. Bring a 100 DKK cash and you'll be fine.",
                    "It will probably be the same guy, but if not, no worries, they will pass the info on. It's routine for them. Kirkja is a default stop.",
                    "Ignore the whole note thing, the 18:30 ferry sails all days without pre-booking.",
                    "Bringing it to Suðuroy is certainly a nice idea. Would recommend!",
                    "I very much liked the Vestmanna boat tour, but my best experience was a full day in Gjógv (incl overnight stay). The Enniberg hike should be awesome but I never did it, unfortunately. Also the boat trip to Fugloy is superb, even when you don't get off board but take a round trip. I also love wandering around through Tórshavn. The great thing is that FO is so small that you can squeeze a lot into a cramped schedule. No need to choose Saksun over Tjørnuvík or Vestmanna, do all of 'm. Even though being in a hurry is contradictory to coming to rest and be inspired...",
                    "Thanks a lot!",
                    "For the bus tickets, I buy them onboard as well?",

                    "The helicopter is strictly non-day trip organized, which means you're not allowed to fly in and out the same day. One way around this is to spend a night out there, which is a real thrill and certainly recommended. For example, you could take the Friday (27th April) helicopter to Mykines and the Sunday morning one back. It's also possible to go there on Sunday and fly back on Monday, but I wouldn't recommend that: if the Monday flight gets cancelled, the next one is Wednesday May 2nd.",
                    "Btw, it's called the Faroe Islands in English, or Føroyar in Faroese, or Færøer (one word) in Danish. I'd recommend you use Føroyar if you want to go local. ((Geek sidenote: in the dative/3rd case, in Faroe, would *í Føroyum))",

                    "I am arriving in Faroes Islands at the end of May and would like to do a day trip to Mykines. What are the chances during that period that weather may cause the ferry or helicopter to cancel?  would like to hear if anyone has experience.",
                    "I saw the helicopter cancelled about a few times and the ferry once. Plus on one ocassion, when I was on Mykines, the ferry couldn't enter the port because of the swell (it was windstill) so she waited 1,5 hours about 300 meters offshore. On the very moment that they decided to return to Vágar, the swell disappeared and they landed anyway.",
                    "Never go to Mykines on your last day, but certainly do it on any other day. I think cancellation risk is 5% for May, a bit less at the end of May. It is worth an unexpected overnight stay however, definitely.  That's kind of the adventure that the place stands for! Or much better: a planned overnight stay. When the tourists leave with the evening ferry, the isle is suddenly your own and the village goes from a \"Disney set\" to a normal village.",

                    "We're visiting the Faroes in May. We've been seeing a lot of posts online about the new rules to hike to certain places such as Kalsoy, Mykines, Drangarnir. Seems like you need to pay a guide and also a fee to go out to some of these places now. There is no concrete info on when these rules take effect, if they have started already and what the restrictions are. Any info is appreciated!",
                    "Hi - I am currently here visiting the Faroe Islands and the only way to hike to Drangarnir is now by guide only. I asked Visit Vagar yesterday if we were able to use any tour guide company considering the sign says the tours are only on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, and the answer was no. The owner will only allow people to hike to Drangarnir thru their preferred guide.",
                    "I'll circle back tomorrow about Kalsoy - heading there tomorrow to see if we can hike to the Kallur Lighthouse. Visit Torshavn said that they have heard that too will be similar to Drangarnir but thought it would be starting 1 May when their tourist season officially begins.",
                    "Thanks for the information! This is so unfortunate...I don’t feel like spending the 550DKK it appears they want for these group hikes for access to each route. A huge appeal of the Faroes was the ability to rent a car and pretty much just explore. It’s a shame if someone disrespected their environment to the point they felt this was necessary, and even more a shame if this is just a money grab.",
                    "It's not so much that individuals have disrespected the environment (though there certainly have been plenty of such cases, stomping on the roof of puffin nests so that the bird comes out for a picture, chasing more or less newborn lamb so that a perfectly cute pic can be taken, stealing eggs, etc)",
                    "It's just the sheer amount of people who are going these places, the traffic is not good for the environment, tearing up the ground and such.  On mykines they have been working on making proper paths now, where before it was just grass, or rather mud.",
                    "Kallur lighthouse, I know the farmer who owns the land has been annoyed over tourists not closing gates, letting sheep roam to other parts etc.",
                    "Also, the tourist season is in the middle of bird breeding season, having an explosion in numbers of people who are roaming everywhere in the countryside, many not knowing correct procedures when stumbling over full nest...",
                    "Also safety, there has been an absolutely marked increase in SAR operations these last few years, where anything from just lost tourists, to broken bones, hypothermia and even fatalities have been on the board.",
                    "Yes, just roaming is appealing, but with everything above, and when you randomly wander into sheep herding efforts and scatter the entire flock because you didn't bother to check with the locals, it's easy to see why people are starting to take money for your exploration.",
                    "Thanks so much for the info! If you could keep the updates coming that’d be great!",
                    "Sorry for the delay - Weather was absolutely horrid and decided not to go to Kalsoy on Friday - but I was able to get some information from the visitor's centre right be the ferry.",
                    "You do need a guide now to get to the Kallur Lighthouse, and the only guide is the farmer himself who owns the land. It does cost $485DKK per person. From what they were saying at the information centre is that he isn't limited to a few days for hikes to the lighthouse like Drangarnir is - he just wants to ensure people going are getting there safely and on the correct path. Like Hitno said, it's due to the amount of traffic and the protection of his land and animals.",
                    "Sounded like you could go very last minute to no notice and the farmer will take you. She was going to call and see if he could take us up Friday afternoon when we could get the next ferry. The information centre is where you go and they will call the farmer to see if he's available.",
                    "There is plenty of other options for hiking that you could do for free and without guides. When you arrive at the Vagar airport, take the hiking guide book. The one hike up to Leitisvatn lake was absolutely stunning and took about 2.5 hours. Also plenty of waterfalls on the side of the road you can hike next to as well.",
                    "Thanks so much for the reply! Your info is very helpful.",
                    "Sucks about the guide being needed now to go out to the lighthouse, but its understandable.",
                    "http://visitvagar.fo/welcome-to-vagar/activities/hiking/drangarnir/",
                    "Here’s what I can find about the hike to Drangarnir. They want $90 to go out there, only available 3X a week, and are saying you can be fined for hiking on this route without permission.",
                    "Very disappointing to find out less than a month prior to the trip",

I've heard that the islands shut down on Sunday, is this true? Also we're looking to catch a local soccer match on the Saturday. Any recommendation on what team to see?",

                    "Hi everyone! Me and a friend are planning on coming to the islands in August, for 5 nights. Kind of unsure as to how to get around. For example, we are coming in from Copenhagen, and fly in to Vagar. But from there should we rent a car? or would it be best to get a bus? And is returning to the airport difficult? Also if anyone has a good itinerary on what to do that would be much appreciated! We are super excited!",
                    "Rental car companies are in the airport and are very easy. The buses are are also very easy to take. Check out www.ssl.fo/en . The last bus stop in Tórshavn is at https://goo.gl/maps/eqoRwXvNYcD2",
                    "As for attractions I would recommend Trælanípan, Gásadalur, Mykines (if you are lucky with the weather), and Kallur Lighthouse. All of these are quite a lot easier to get to if you have a car but it can be done without.",
                    "We went last year for a week, we are also going again this year in August like you! It’s such an amazing place you’re going to love it!",
                    "We stayed in an Airbnb on Streymoy so pretty central, we just drove around to each place during the day. You shouldn’t have to drive more than a few hours round trip due to the size of the islands. We got to see quite a lot in the week but missed out on a few places, hence why we’re returning!",
                    "Itinerary wise, here’s what we did as a guide:",
                    "Day 1; flight was delayed so didn’t arrive until around 9:30pm, picked up the rental car (62° north) and headed to the Airbnb then went to bed.",
                    "Day 2: we headed north to Tjørnuvik, a lovely village. Only one way in and out, there’s the waterfall ‘Fossá’ on the way so keep an eye out on the left. We hiked up the mountains towards Saksun but decided to turn back halfway. We didn’t want to have to hike back the whole way again for the car on our 1st day!  We then drove to Tórshavn as it was the Faroese national day, was lots of street food/beer stands and had a stroll around taking in the atmosphere.",
                    "Day 3: We took the ferry to Mykines in the morning and stayed overnight. We did the hike to the lighthouse and watched the sunset from up the hill on the way back.",
                    "Day 4: We took the ferry back in the morning then headed to Gásadalur, where the famous waterfall ‘Múlafossur’ is. Spent a couple of hours here then we drove back past Vagar airport to Leitisvatn, from here we hiked up to where probably the most well known place is. The ‘lake above the ocean’ the cliffs are incredible here and really magical when you see it in real life! We watched the sunset here then hiked back to the car. Was pretty late by then so went straight back to the Airbnb.",
                    "Day 5: We actually got up pretty late as we were so tired from the day before, was a busy day! But we drove to Saksun just after lunch, hiked up the mountain for an hour or so and took in some views. Then we headed back down and walked along the sand out in the lagoon, you can walk right to the ocean it’s an incredible place. One of my favourites! After we drove up to Gjógv and around Funningur for the sunset then headed back.",
                    "Day 5: We drove down to Sørvágur just passed the airport and hiked out to Tindhólmur, this is a pretty tough hike. The start is at the end of an old ship yard I think it was, was actually pretty hard to spot as we didn’t have any information about the hike. The terrain is pretty bad in places too and the trail disappears a lot, if there’s one at all. We spent most of the day here due to the initial confusion and finding the trails.",
                    "Day 6: We drove to Klaksvík to catch the ferry to Kalsoy, unfortunately we just missed it by one car so didn’t get to go. The next ferry wasn’t going to leave us enough time there so we drove up to some of  the northern islands. Had a look around Vidareidi and found a few waterfalls on our drive back.",
                    "I’d say the must see places would definitely be;",
                    "Gásadalur, Leitisvatn (Lake above the ocean) if you go early enough you could easily see these both in one day and still have plenty of time. Saksun and Tjørnuvik, both beautiful little villages and a lovely hike between them. Tindhólmur, quite a tough hike but well worth it! Kalsoy, which we didn’t get to see. Heard and seen only good things from here so we will make sure we get the ferry this time! There’s so many really but if you need any more tips let me know",

                    "Hey Guys, Thanks for hosting us on a recent holiday to the Faroes. Your home is beautiful and the people we met were both lovely and very helpful.",
                    "We loved everything we saw and we got very lucky with the weather over Easter.",
                    "I have two very random questions.",
                    "while travelling the islands we noticed in many towns lots of Wooden posts connected by wire often draped in green netting or with rolled up green netting. We spent a lot of time speculating what is going on and what they are for. Could some one clarify are they \"Fishing Nets hanging out to dry\"? or something else?",
                    "The Faroes community and population is quite small even at 50,000 people. We had a question about death on the island. Does any one know how many Morgues and morticians there are on the islands? We saw several cemeteries. But we were wondering the following about Death:",
                    "How many morticians and morgues are there?",
                    "Do cremations take place in the Faroes?",
                    "Is there a limit to how long one can be burried within a cemetery in the Faroes.",
                    "Do \"At Sea\" burials occur in the Faroes?",
                    "Is \"Burial Space\" an issue.",
                    "Thanks in advance for the random questions. But the life of small communities is foreign to me living in very large cities.",
                    "We love you all. Would come back again soon!",
                    "Do you have any picture of the rolled up green netting?",
                    "Yep... and it looks like it answers my question for me but.. could some one clarify. They are for feeding the sheep so they don't dig up all the grass and leave only mdu or are they drying the grass for some other reason? Or am i miles off?",
                    "They dry it.",
                    "Don't know how many morgues there are but I'm guessing atleast 3 since there are 3 hospitals and no private companies do burials for people afaik. Some people get cremated but I don't know if they do it in the main hospital or they send the bodies to denmark.",
                    "Never heard of any burials at sea and space is always a problem on islands this small especially in larger villages.",
                    "There are no facilities for cremation in the Faroes, most people who get cremated are Faroese who have died in other countries, mostly for ease of transporting their remains back to the islands for burial.",
                    "Mortician things are taken care off by the hospitals usually, but we have a few undertakers, mostly dealing with organizing funerals and helping out with practical stuff during the proceedings.",
                    "Hearses are usually offered by either the church or municipality, as some cemeteries belong to the municipality where they are.",
                    "It is illegal in the Faroes to be buried outside a cemetery (unless you go back the ye olde days, where people condemned to death and kids who died without being baptized were laid to rest outside of the cemetery). There was a guy more recently (but still ways back... 40 or 50 years ago ... guestimating) that wanted to be buried at Norðadalsskarð, apparently he petitioned for it, but was denied."

                    "Very excited to be visiting the islands in early September.  We are planning on doing four full days and have the following questions.",
                    "We are planning on renting a car from the airport and using it the duration of the trip. I'm assuming this would be the best option to see what the country has to offer but would love to hear if otherwise. We definitely want to venture out to some of the remote areas. Any rental companies to recommend?",
                    "With only 4 days, would you recommend having 1 home base or 2, staying a few nights at each? What would be the best areas to stay in if we plan on driving around to see most of the Islands' sites? We are looking at Airbnb's for lodging.",
                    "Is four days a decent amount of time to see/hike most things? We consider ourselves very fit in our late twenties. We are also very fast paced and are not looking for much of a 'relaxing' stay. There is the possibility we could extend to a fifth day.",
                    "Any tips are greatly appreciated!",
                    "Rental car is probably a good idea. There's been new rental companies popping up during the past years, don't have any experience with most of them. I would however stay away from AVIS.",
                    "Tórshavn is very central. Just look at google maps for the distance, with a car you can get from there to pretty much anywhere that has a direct road connection within 90 minutes.",
                    "Most things? No. If you actually want to see the Faroes you'll need at least a week. Having a car is jolly good, but as soon as it comes to some of the really nice spots like Mykines and Suðuroy you'll be limited by ferry timetables, which makes things so much more time consuming. So sure, you can stress through most of the hikes around the main islands (Streymoy/Eysturoy) within 4 days, but I wouldn't plan too many things \"off the beaten path\" in that case. Seems awfully stressful to me in any case, but maybe you like it that way ;)",
                    "Thank you!",
                    "I would personally recommend you to use 62°N or MakeTravel for car rental. They are in the more expensive end, but the cars are almost all brand new, and the service is great.",
                    "Thanks, will check them out for sure",
                    "Hello! I went last year and I was there for four days.",
                    "For a rental car, I used unicar and it was fine...no issues whatsoever. Picked it up and dropped off at the airport!",
                    "Like someone else said, Tórshavn is quite central, and we stayed in an Airbnb in Argir. It was a perfect spot, as we just headed or to a different part of the country each day!",
                    "My friends and I were originally there for four days, but our flight was delayed a day because of all the fog. But I thought it was enough time to do the highlights. We didn’t do any intense hikes, and we just drove around everywhere. We also stopped off like every five minutes of driving just to take in the views! If you’re just wanting to do the big stuff (Mulafossur, Sorvagsvatn, Gjogv and so on) then I think four days is alright! Be careful, though, as the weather is in charge of everything.",
                    "HAVE THE BEST TIME. The faroes were definitely one of my favorite places I’ve ever been!",
                    "Edited to add: we stayed here with three people and it was perfect and the host was very gracious and welcoming. Long link bc on mobile, sorry!",
                    "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13275873?location=T%C3%B3rshavn%2C%20Streymoy%2C%20Faroe%20Islands&s=e76cthIM",
                    "I can can concur with this post. I was there 3 weeks ago. I also used UNICAR it was perfect. They even let us keep the car longer when our departing flight was delayed by 6 hours. So we could see more. The point about ferry time tables, from the other post, is very accurate also. We almost got stuck haha.",
                    "We stayed in 4 places for the 4 nights. But this was more so we could see more locations and enjoy different properties. You could, if you were willing, do a drive \"home\" to the single location each night if you liked.",
                    "It was seriously stunning and lovely. I am currently posting a photo a day of the Faroes on my instagram if you are interested. http://instagram.com/timbohiatt",
                    "If you have questions or want more information then please PM me would be happy to give you any help you liked. Cause we learnt a lot but we had the absolute best time! :-)",
                    "We used http://www.streymcars.com for the rental. Even though they can arrange a pick up or drop-off at the airport for a surcharge, we just took the bus from the airport to the capital and picked it up from their base in Torshavn.",
                    "When you pick a car from the airport, keep in mind that you will most likely pay a surcharge plus you will also have to pay the tunnel toll to get to Torshavn where you might be staying on the first night.",
                    "Torshavn might be the only good place for tourists considering the various hotel and restaurant options available. No matter which island you are on, you are never too far away from Torshavn. You can always head back at the end of the day.",
                    "You might also want to look at staying in Klaksvik, if you want to spend more time exploring the islands in the east. Seemed like a cute little town worth staying at. But we didn't do that.",
                    "We also had 4 days like you, and for us it was perfect to get an idea of what the whole place is like. The car helped us in getting everywhere, plus we also had time to do 2 hikes. One to the Kallur Lighthouse, and the other to the lake in Sorvagsvatn."

I've just been accepted to study in the Faroe Islands for two years as apart of the Master's in West Nordic Studies - Governance and Sustainable Management program. I have never travelled to the Faroes or anywhere around the area, so I am unsure of how easy it is to find accommodations. If anyone could help me out with this, that would be great! Thanks!",

I am very interested in everything about the Faroe Islands and have been ever since December-ish when I researched for and wrote an essay about the role of music in the revitalization of the Faroese language (I was so interested I wrote 27 pages- 12 more than necessary!). I would love to make a friend from the Faroes! You can tell me anything you want about your life and even teach me some Faroese! I like cats, music, literature, and linguistics and speak English and Spanish. But I'll talk about anything! I would like to correspond over email, though we can start out messaging on Reddit if you feel more comfortable with that. I tend to take about a week to respond.",

                    "Hello all,",
                    "I am planning a trip to the islands most likely at the beginning of July for about 10 days by myself (mid 20s male) and have a few things I would like clarified/confirmed before I book flights and accommodations etc.",
                    "I greatly appreciate anyone taking the time to help me out in this regard.",
                    "I have read through the past 50 or so posts here to get a good general idea of the most important information and I have done a fair amount of googling as well. I just want to confirm what I have read is correct, all opinions/perspectives are appreciated.",
                    "Accommodations:",
                    "I'm very interested in tenting nearby villages and I have read that it is possible so long as you obtain permission from the land owner. I have read some people say that this is fairly easily done. Would you agree with this? How likely is it on a scale of 1-10 that I would be able to tent on someone's land? I'd obviously be very respectful of the land and leave nothing behind. I know that designated campgrounds are an option as well but I'm not as interested in that. Also, I'm aware the weather can be pretty messy so I'd have to be ok with that while being in a tent.",
                    "Alternatively I would aim for hostels/Air Bnb's to save costs. I'm having difficulties finding information on different hostels. I found a few in Torshavn, are there others? I've tried looking without too much luck. If someone could link websites that would be super helpful.",
                    "I've found a few AirBnBs that could be suitable.",
                    "Also, couch surfing. I haven't signed up yet but I'm thinking about it. Has anyone had any experience couch surfing in the Faroes?",
                    "Transit:",
                    "Judging from my research on rental cars, I think I'm going to pass on renting a car just because of the expense. So I'd be opting for public transport. I'm aware the timetables need to be studied carefully to plan my days and that not everywhere is accessible via public transport.",
                    "However, I've also read that hitchhiking is fairly easy to do. If I were to combine public transit and hitchhiking, would I be able to get around to the main points of interest? I'm alright with a few hours of travel time, I start my days early.",
                    "I think those are my main concerns that I'd like addressed before I move forwards on the trip. If anyone would like more info from me please ask.",
                    "Really appreciate anyone taking a stab at any of my questions. Apologies that some of these are repetitive, I've done my research, I just want confirmation/clarification to feel more comfortable.",
                    "Thanks!",
                    "Hey there First of all, well done on the research. Spot on. My advice. Tents are always risky at the Faroes. The winds. Just DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE WINDS .I spent 3 weeks there. Public transport that includes ferries (except to mykinnes) is amazing. You need special tickets to mykinnes. Otherwise the busses and ferries are perfect to all islands. These 4 day tickets with unlimited hop on and off is the way to go. I always made back to Torshavn except when I was up north at klaksvik. Try airbnb. Otherwise. Enjoy the stay and the islands.",
                    "Hi, would you say that walking + using public transport is overall better than renting a bicycle and spending the whole trip on it?",
                    "Hiya. Bike. Sure. It's a personal choice there. If u r fit to go up and down and up and up and downhill. Why not. But beware. There are not any dedicated bikelanes. Public transport though is well networked. If u for mind shedding an extra dollar r two. Then you can rent a car as well",
                    "Thanks for the fast reply!",
                    "One more question - what do you think about camping elsewhere than in camping sites? I've read different opinions about it, some were saying that it is prohibited, some that it is too dangerous and some were completely OK with it.",
                    "The camp sites exist. Use them. I wouldn't camp outside camp sites. A because it is illegal. And b  ( no offence meant ) we completely undermine nature and wind. It can be lethal. Usually someone at the campsite might tell u that it could be super windy etc etc. But when u r out on it own. Not sure if us folks ( outsiders) will be able to judge that.",
                    "Edit. Don't camp elsewhere. That A just my two cents",
                    "Sounds reasonable, thanks. .)",
                    "You can ask the owner of the land to pitch a tent. However finding said person can be a challenge, as he could be at sea.",
                    "Or he might live on a different island... And sometimes the owner doesn't care, but you might be in trouble with the caretaker of the land.",
                    "We stayed for 4 nights in torshavn at an Airbnb. It was relatively cheap as we were 2. But the place was just amazing. The guy who rents out his place made us all breakfast every morning and was a good way to start the day. Plus talking to a local is always a good way to know more about a place. I can PM you the place if you like.",
                    "There are a few popular Couchsurfing hosts around the island, but you being a new member I am not sure how successful you will be in getting a host as you don't have any references yet. But it's still worth a try.",
                    "As for renting a car, I'd say it's worth it. I am a budget backpacker when I travel, but renting a car in the Faroe was one of those things that I think was worth every single penny. We landed at the airport and took the bus to Torshavn, where we had booked the cheapest car available. A VW Up! Just the idea of being free to do whatever you want, whenever you want it without being dependent on bus timings is in itself a blessing.",
                    "Plus I am a huge fan of driving. And the roads there are very well connected with little to no traffic. It's waiting to be explored! I don't think we would have seen some of the places if we were relying on public transport.",
                    "If you could PM me the Airbnb and where you rented the car from that would be really helpful! Appreciate that.",
                    "Sure, done.",
                    "Hi, could you forward these details to me as well?",
                    "Done. Let me know if you need any further details.",
                    "Thank you so much for this.. I'm visiting the islands between the 5th and 10th of November and I just want to gather all the information I can to make it a memorable stay... I currently have a reservation at Sandavágur.. Would you recommend staying for the duration of the trip at Sandavágur and travelling every day to other islands or should I split my stay between torshavn and Sandavágur?",
                    "You won't have any problems, distance-wise, to travel everyday to other islands. I'm not sure what Sandavagur is like, when it comes to restaurants. In Torshavn, there were quite a few options to choose from, when it comes to drinks and meals in the evenings.",
                    "You should also consider the toll for the two tunnels that connect the islands. If you are leaving Vagar everyday of your stay, that's a fair bit of money that you can save by staying in Torshavn.",
                    "If you are ok with the above, then I don't see why you need to change your existing bookings. I have never been to Sandavagur, just drove thru it. So I don't know much about it.",
                    "Do you mind sending me a PM with your airbnb recommendation as well? I'm going in August. Do you feel like Torshavn was the best place to make home base?",
                    "I'll send the PM. Yes, Torshavn might be the only good place for tourists considering the various hotel and restaurant options available. No matter which island you are on, you are never too far away from Torshavn. You can always head back at the end of the day.",
                    "You might also want to look at staying in Klaksvik, if you want to spend more time exploring the islands in the east. Seemed like a cute little town worth staying at. But we didn't do that.",
                    "You can check my comment on this thread for an alternate perspective. Personally, having multiple 'bases' allowed me to further explore specific areas since I never had to go all the way back to one certain area (less of a time crunch).",
                    "Renting a car was definitely worth it when I was there as well. If you ever go back, check out the Airbnb on Nolsoy which is very close to Torshavn.",
                    "Hitchhiking can get you far, but of course it's risky as you might not get picked up at all. I personally always pick up hitchhikers, and go out of my way to get them where they need to go, but I've also heard stories from people who have been waiting for hours, and not have a single car stopping to offer them a lift.",
                    "If I were you, I would consider having renting a car for part of your stay, to get you to the most remote places, and where the public transport isn't well connected. Yes, it is expensive, but well worth it.",
                    "I had to hitchhike back to my car, after a 10km hike where I ended up on a different part of the island. Was a very different experience as I have never hitchhiked in my life, and I had no other choice as there were no public transport on that route.",
                    "Had to take 3 different cars to get where I wanted. Didn't wait for too long. I probably flagged around 15 cars before one stopped. So not too bad IMO.",
                    "If you end up choosing Airbnb over tenting (although tenting would be preferable in my eyes as well), I can suggest a few. One other commenter slept in Torshavn the whole time, which does work quite well. During my 7 day trip in March 2017, I stayed on three different islands and would strongly recommend that, although I did have a rental car. It allows for more exploration in specific areas since a person doesn't have to worry about transport back to one location every time.",
                    "I stayed on Vagar, Nolsoy, and Eysturoy. My name on Airbnb is Keith Wuest, maybe you can look up the locations on my profile? The family on Nolsoy is so friendly and the small restaurant on the island has a great atmosphere.. I cannot remember the name of it.",
                    "I used the Vagar Airbnb to explore that island and the host directed me to a lesser known trail and lake that was lovely. The Nolsoy Airbnb was for exploration on that island and for my time in Torshavn. The Eysturoy Airbnb was for my northern island travels (Bordoy, Kalsoy, and Vidoy).",
                    "Writing this is bringing back all of the memories.. That trip was truly an amazing experience. I am so excited for you! I'm sure my Airbnbs are not necessarily better than other choices but I do know these hosts would aid in providing you with an even better experience. No matter what you choose to do in terms of accommodation, be ready for a really unique time."

We will be renting a car and driving around as much of the country as we can, so could really eat anywhere, but our base will be in Torshavn right by the harbor.",

                    "It's been a lifelong dream of mine to visit the Faroe Islands and I am finally thinking of going this summer with my toddler and husband. We live in central Europe and do not own a car and we greatly prefer to utilize public transit, walking and biking when we travel. Would we be able to see some sights on the Faroe Islands and take a few hikes without renting a car? We'd be open to taking an occasional taxi, but I'm wondering if it's do-able to spend several days just using public transit, ferries, etc.",
                    "Would require some planning, but is doable. Utilise the heli service as well, as it’s relatively cheap. There’s options for tourists at SSL.fo - some cards you can buy and use transport as you see fit. Always make plan A & B due to weather",
                    "As mentioned this will require a lot more planning on your part. You can get to most places easily for example Kallur Lighthouse (ferry from klaksvík and connecting bus to and from Trøllanes), Kirkjubø (Almost hourly free bus from Tórshavn), Nólsoy (cheap ferry from Tórshavn) etc.",
                    "Some places might be harder to get to for example Gásadalur. Unfortunately you can not book return flights on the same day by helicopter so you will either need to stay there a day or take the ferry (For example Mykines) but I would definitely recommend you take a look at tyrla.atlantic.fo and ssl.fo and also rib62.com for sightseeing.",

My personal preference for holidays is, rather than to try to see everything in a dense-packed program, to spend a day or two in cool places and relax. With this approach public transport works perfectly fine.",
                    "Hitchhiking also works well, although it can be difficult to get a ride out of Tórshavn, so take the bus out and hitchhike back."

                    "Hey everyone, I'm planning on visiting the Islands during the second week of May and was debating between spending 1 week or 2 weeks here. I plan on renting an Airbnb along with a car, and want to do lots of hiking, naturally!",
                    "Nope. I spent a week there several years ago and was only able to explore Streymoy and Esturoy (and not those as thoroughly as I would have liked). Several trips can have weather complications (Mykines and the eastern islands, if I recall correctly) so you might have to wait for a good window. Two weeks would give you time to relax and see all the things you want to see.",
                    "Yes Mykines is a place which is not always available. But i wish it was, its magnificent.",
                    "Exactly. I did not get to visit, but talked to another traveler that had and heard great stories. I'll be back sometime to see more of what the Islands have to offer!",
                    "I recommend taking a helicopter instead of a boat.",
                    "Or both. By helicopter in, by boat out. In hindsight, I found the ride much more impressive than the flight (the first lasts 45 mins, the other only 6).",

                    "Hey,",
                    "I'm coming to the faore islands in may, and would like to check out mykines (weather permitting). I understand that you have to have a guide. Do know of a guide that you would recommend? I'm have a hard time finding any reviews on guides.",
                    "Not at all... it's just the perfect amout of time to absorb everything that the nature and people have to offer at faroes.",
                    "Definitely not too long. I holidayed there for two weeks and came back a few months later for three months. The more time the better to explore due to the unpredictable weather. I always pitied people who came for four days and only saw fog.",
                    "Did you rent a car while you were there either of the times?",
                    "Oh I thought I replied. Sorry. Yes. First time I rented second time my friend lent me theirs. I'd recommend especially if you're going outside of summer. If you're going in summer you'll easily be able to hitchhike. And safely.",
                    "I'm going for 11 days and the rental cost is $2000 CAD for all 11 days. Would I be fine renting just for a few days instead?",

                    "Is there any \"risk\" that you may return, for example when you aren't New Zealandic or Alaskan? Then I'd stick to 10 days, leaving a few things for a possible future trip.",
                    "This philosophy sounds perhaps odd, but it works fine for me. I always want to see and experience a lot, but I always skip things in order to A) have a less rushing experience of the things I don't skip and B) have a reason to come back.",
                    "Planning to visit for 11 days to be exact! From what everyone else is saying, it should be an appropriate amount :)"

It might be hard to believe but an Ancient Greek explorer, Pytheas explored Britain in 300 years B.C (Before Christ). He mentioned a place called Thule, which was 5 days sailing north of the Orkneys. He wrote about the daylight and also mentioned how eventually the land was like a jellyfish where no boat could sail, but no man could walk. This must have been when his boat reached the icy waters of the Arctic circle.",

                    "Great question. I'm using Kristján Árnason's book The Phonology of Icelandic and Faroese as a guide. Firstly, you are hearing this mostly right, but rather than [tʃ] it is actually [tʃʰ] (this is important because there is a fortis-lenis opposition in Faroese and Icelandic using aspiration). I'm not sure it has much to do with the syllable structure. He gives an example of hjóla 'wheel' which has the same onset as hjá and is closed like hjálpa.",
                    "I would think it could be influence of Modern Danish hjælpe, but Árnason notes this pronunication goes back to Middle Faroese. As /u/Tidligare suggests, this could have to do with word frequency, where the rule seems to have been palatalization of velar stops bordering /j/ (fricative onsets seem to have often become stops in Faroese), but resulted in deletion of /h/ in less frequent words. I would support the former claim by comparing Icelandic, where /hj/ has become realized as [ç].",
                    "EDIT: Wrote this pretty early in the morning and just realized hjóla actually consists of two open syllables, so I’m curious as to whether you’re onto something with the syllable.",
                    "So more frequent words use [tʃʰ], and less frequent ones us [j]?",
                    "Possibly, but that's certainly not a verified truth. For example, I notice the named Hjalmar, which, correct me if I'm wrong, is a somewhat common name in the Faroe Islands, is pronounced with [j]. I'm curious as to how many words that historically had an /hj/ onset are now only pronounced [j]. From all the examples I could find, it's mostly [tʃʰ].",
                    "For these kind of questions may I direct you to the facebook group \"Føroysk rættstaving\" ?  https://www.facebook.com/groups/185932738087033/",

                    "Mind that March is the off-season. The weather can be hellish, and people live an indoors life. Getting a ride is a question of patience (since there are few cars) and visibility, but not a matter of a lack of goodwill! I hope that you plan a stay of at least three days; two isn't a lot. On your way from the airport to Tórshavn, if you do this by taxi, you can ask them to make a detour here and there at an extra charge. Use every minute of your time!",
